A second Datacide release in a similar, though more ambient vein (and titled, of course, Datacide II) appeared the following year before Tetsu Inoue and Uwe Schmidt switched gears for their first Rather Interesting release, Flowerhead, an album of laidback ambient-jazz. Ondas, released in 1996, upped Flowerhead's weirdness factor significantly, dwelling for most of the album in channel separation experiments which fused the rhythmic abstraction of Atom Heart's recent solo work with the fizzier, more left-field of Tetsu Inoue's electronic treatments (Tetsu Inoue's girlfriend, Ingrid, even makes an extended cameo on \"mouth trumpet\").",

Born in Chile, and raised in Sweden, Alexi started a radio show from a suburb of Stockholm at the tender age of 15. In the late 1980's, Alexi took a trip to Spain where he discovered electronic music and more specifically, house music. Upon returning to Sweden, Alexi's interest in electronic based dance music was born. Teaming up with his friend Cari Lekebusch, Alexi and Cari co-produced Alexi's first record entitled 'Life on the Other Side' for Swedish based Loop records. After being received very well by the dance community, Alexi started to produce more and more for a number of different labels including Cari Lekebush's own imprint Hybrid, Tim Taylor's imprint Missile, Steve Bug's label Raw Elements, Plumphouse, Svek, Jericho, Primevil, Christian Smith's Strive label, Earthtones, and now Plastic City. In the mid-1990's, Alexi relocated to NYC to seek both new inspirations while at the same time developing his skills as a musical producer. Since transplanting to NYC, Alexi has continued assaulting the dance floors world-wide with his DJing around the continent, many solo productions as well as collaborations with artists such as Jesper Dahlback (a.k.a. The Persuader, Cari Lekebusch, Casey Hogan, and Lucas Rodenbush. Since arriving in NYC, Alexi has spent much of his time developing his A.D.N.Y. moniker. A recent long-player out on the Earthtones label collaborated with Jesper Dahlback as well as his A.D.N.Y. presents Leiva album on Plastic City are two of the most current projects. While, Alexi did collaborate with Casey Hogan on some of the tracks for Leiva, it is in essence his debut solo album.",

[l283]’s [a4450] called them upon hearing the fruits of their studio endeavours and offered to release the first wave of SWAG material. In the meantime [a8783]’s DJ schedule was busy as ever, touring commitments with WARP acts as well as his numerous residencies meant his day job in the record store was becoming increasingly part-time. When the store finally closed in ‘96, [a8783] decided it was time to establish his own outlet for the music he was recording. His labels ‘[l541]’ and ‘[l1322]’ were started and immediately began releasing music from themselves and a host of other like-minded artists who threw out the House rulebook, a policy which helped their releases find their way into the record boxes of the world’s best DJ’s. The SWAG project had begun to lose momentum, as their relationship with [l283] grew more strained. Two years of running his own labels had given [a8783] the confidence to start out fresh with SWAG, this time on another new, self owned label ‘[l3974]’. Over the last ten years the SWAG partnership has been behind over fifty original tracks, and many more remixes for international artists like [a1373], [a22217] and [a1661], as well as definitive work and collaborations for dozen’s of underground labels. Their own imprints have built up an international following, making [a8783]’s DJ schedule as hectic as ever, and ensuring their ‘Decks And Gadgets’ shows have rocked clubs from Tokyo to Madrid and Sydney, not to mention classic UK parties like the Sub Club, Back to Basics and Fabric. With two acclaimed LP’s under their belts and each new project presenting fresh challenges and room for the duo to push their music even further, the SWAG sound has become an integral part of the underground global music scene, and [a8783] celebrated as one of the world’s most valued DJ talents.",

In an industry where many DJs get booked due to the merits of their production work, Rob stands out as a DJ who has played across North America and Europe without a single production credit to his name. No production credits, that is, until now… His first 12” with Leon Louder on the East Coast Boogiemen’s Label Odds n Ends was featured on JT Donaldson and Lance Desardi’s San Francisco Sessions on OM. Other releases are to follow on labels such as Muzique Boutique, GuessWho, Peaches and Momma’s home Cookin, in addition to unreleased tracks have been receiving play by dj’s like Derrick Carter, Mark Farina, Raoul, Heather, Diz, Luke Solomon and Miss Honey Dijon. In his hometown of Montreal, Rob has held residencies at such legendary clubs as Angel’s, SONA, Groove Society, Upperclub and more recently the world famous STEREO. He has also had the opportunity to travel across North America and Europe playing alongside Dj’s such as DJ Spen, Derrick Carter, John Howard, Jeno, Onionz, Mark Farina, Diz, Tony Humphries, Fred Everything and Dj heather to name a few. Musically, Rob is not easily pigeonholed. His sets weave together all types of house music with either a reckless Chicago based mixing technique, or a smoother more programming oriented method. He is nearly always in the mix, yet he understands the delicate balance between layering sounds to create something new and giving a song room to breathe. He constantly monitors the room and reacts to the crowd in a way that makes even a big room setting feel intimate.",

After his father, who by the way is in the Radio business uprooted Casey multiple times, they finally settled in Tennessee after short stays in Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Colorado, and Kentucky. Growing up around the radio business was definitely a benefit for Casey. He was exposed to all kinds of music from Jazz and disco to electro, 80's electronic and everything else under the sun. Although Casey appreciated many of the different styles he was exposed to, the newbeat/industrial sound of the late 80's is definitely what caught his attention. Stuff from [a=Pink Floyd], [a=Depeche Mode], [a=Level 42], and New Order, is what initially got him started. Not to long after that, Casey was also particularly interested in the scratching and hip-hop thing as well as the moody techno sounds coming out of Detroit. As early as 1991, Casey was making mix-tapes of his favorite tunes for his friends. At the same time Casey also began dabbling in production. He would go down to his father's radio station and work on the multitrack dubbing carts, splicing tape, and editing commercials after school. Not to long after in 1992 Casey began performing at both raves and clubs throughout the South and Southeast as a DJ. After building some experience in the studio, in 1994 Casey began to create his own music. He initially started with drum machines. Then he began to build his studio up. At that point Casey decided it was time for even more changes. Although the scene down south was growing, it seemed it would never catch up with the big cities of the north like Detroit, Chicago, or New York. So in the spring of 1996, Casey packed up and moved to NYC. Once he arrived in NYC, Casey began doing sound design/engineering for quite a few multimedia companies doing everything from original scores, to remixes, to edits, to everything else that takes place in a production house. Not too long after this, Casey got a job at the world-renowned vinyl shop [l=Sonic Groove].",

Throughout his high school career, he studied electronic music at a public art-based magnet school shortly after moving to San Jose, California from a suburb of Dallas, Texas.  His love for electronic music developed from artists like [a=Depeche Mode], [a=New Order], [a=Ministry], [a=Electronic] and [a=Erasure], yet his discovery of techno music in 1992 sent him forward with a direct purpose.  After years of appreciation and analysis, he developed a sense of production and rapport with his own sound.  In 1994, he took a cassette of some music he had made to a local record store called Outer Rhythm, soon to be changed to Solid Grooves.  He played it for the owner, was met with some constructive criticism, reflected and revised accordingly.  Over the next year, through periodic listening and consultation sessions, he collected four pieces of playable dance music.  It was then, in 1995, that Solid Grooves, the record label, was founded with \"EBE Audio - The Energy EP\" as a first release.  Since then, Rodenbush has gone on to release projects with Transmat, Soma, Plastic City, Grayhound, Afterhours, Resource Records, Jump Recordings, Organised Noise, and several others.  In 2003, he began his residence at the California Institute of the Arts, studying the technology of Electronic and Acoustic musics to earn his BFA in Music Technology.  He continued there, in 2005, as an MFA candidate of Experimental Sound Practices, studying the relationship between real-world sound sources and the digital domain through the crafting of interactive sound spaces.  He also has an Associate of Arts in Film & Television from De Anza College.",

A close cousin provided him with what was a new style of music at that time, and it would change his life forever. Although the seeds of house music were planted in Chicago's culture rich pockets during the late 1970's and early 80's, its presence had yet to be felt in the fertile farmlands of the Mississippi Delta. ||||| But down deep in Greenwood, Mississippi that spring, a new disciple of underground ambience was baptized. It's a fact that Chris experienced a bad reaction to house music while listening to it for the first time. But just as time is needed to acquire a proper palette for drinking fine wine and eating exotic cuisine, Chris eventually developed a taste for the essence of life that many crave. He began devouring the new house ambrosia with uncontrollable addiction. Over the years he collected a wide variety of house mixtapes from all over the globe. This hobby would ultimately inspire him to develop The Deephouse Projekt in 1990. This project is Chris' ongoing search to explore and understand the roots of house music and its perpetual migrations. Phone and the internet research produced many credible sources who taught him about house music's controversial history. Sources include those pioneers who were present at the original Warehouse club, Bismark and other legendary Chicago nightspots that served as shelters for the house music community. So motivated and eager, he embarked upon his own pilgrimage by blindly relocating to Chicago. The year was 1992 and he felt it was time to chase yet another dream after he finished university. ||||| There isn't tangible evidence per se that it was Chris' destiny to make a mark in Chicago, but he quickly settled in and continued his work anyway. And to note, he'd never visited the city before relocating. Chris quickly learned that politics and greed were present in many facets of Chicago life and unfortunately the house scene wasn't exempt. But he refused to get involved with negative fraternization and allowed an ancient spirit to be resurrected though his music instead. It is this very spirit that helps him and other devoted followers to continue uplifting and exploring this unique music form. Note: Kennedy-King College's WKKC 89.3 FM is a university radio station located on the south side of Chicago. It was an early supporter of the house community and developed a number of artists over a 20 year span.",

  "profile": "From his misspent youth skateboarding the frontier towns of North Eastern England, Martin Iveson arrived into the UK’s Midland scene in the early nineties, here he was to take a job at a new computer games development studio by the name of Core Design Ltd., this company is now synonymous with Lara Croft and the series of Tomb Raider games. Not content with scoring this, one of the world’s most famous video games, Martin left the company 13 years later to concentrate more on his own studio environment in which to channel his musical aspirations further, and invite other musicians and producers to do the same. The success of his early works including his first EP ‘Story’ in 1996 led to the well-received album ‘That Something’, which was later licensed in Japan by Sony/Kioon in 1998. This debut album also featured cover artwork by Fujio Akatsuka, very well known in Japan for his Illustrations and animated cartoons. With two further albums, ‘Labfunk’& ‘Labresults’ following soon after, Atjazz had at this time established himself as a distinct and inspirational voice in the underground music scene. Martin has also been a prolific remixer throughout his career remixing and reworking songs& works for artists such as Nitin Sawhney, Bob Sinclar, Jazzanova, Zed Bias & Omar to name but a few and was even requested to rework Henri Mancini’s ‘The Pink Panther Returns” for EMI Records. Martin is still remixing heavily as he states that remixing has helped to launch his production techniques forward and it’s the perfect practice pitch for trying out new ideas and breaking the mould within a diluted industry. “Remixing helps to hone your sound and allows the producer to print their trademark into another space” Martin’s trademark sound has been requested on many occasions by top class vocalists including Clara Hill, Replife& Deborah Jordan for their own artist album projects and also rubbing shoulders with some amazing musicians & producers along the way. Martin has also teamed up with world-class production legend Charles Webster as ‘Version’ and are working on their debut album for Miso Records. 2009 saw Martin close his label Mantis Recordings due to harsh industry changes and from these ashes came the Imprint appropriately named ‘Atjazz Record Company’, which has flown to great heights within the digital realm and has seen many fantastic and sought after releases including his 3rd long player ‘Full Circle’. This label concentrates heavily on Martin’s productions and collaborations. Atjazz Record Company is a new chapter for Atjazz but with a continuation of his trademark sound. Martin ‘Atjazz’ Iveson is in demand across the world: Whether it be renowned producer, sought after remixer, or floor filling DJ, Martin gives his heart to hold the soul.",

A Consultant and Tech Expert in the areas of Computer Music, Hardware and Software and DJ Equipment who's opinion is sought in the design and development of new products. Headphones and in ear monitors are a particular area of interest and expertise. Involved in many major brand and product launch initiatives in DJ, Remixer, Curator, and Music Director roles. A classically-trained pianist and cellist from Cornwall, he met Richard D James (The Aphex Twin) in 1989. He learned the science of sound sampling and synth programming by observing Richard in the studio. This friendship lead to Tom co-producing a track for the 'Analogue Bubblebath' EP as Schizophrenia, which has now reached cult status. Tom introduced Richard to Mighty Force Records and helped broker the record deal for the EP. After graduating in Graphic Design in 1991, Tom met Mark Pritchard, a Producer/DJ with similar musical tastes. The pair set up the Evolution Records imprint (which later became Universal Language Productions Ltd and the final incarnation as E3.) They recorded under an number pseudonyms, from Reload (Techno and IDM), Global Communication (Electronica and Ambient) - notably developing the principal of integrating pure emotions in sound, Secret Ingredients (Deep House), and one of the most popular projects; Jedi Knights (Electro Boogie, P-Funk, Breakbeats, House), whose album 'New School Science' notably inspired the likes of The Prodigy (who sampled Jedi Knights 'Air Drums From Outer Bongolia' for their track 'Climbatize') and The Chemical Brothers to Daft Punk, The Freestylers and Adam Freeland. Tom hosted a weekly Radio show on Kiss FM, tutored the winning aspiring DJ Ryan Shaw on ITV's Joy Of Decks TV show and has curated events and Festival spaces including Sound Of The Cosmos at The Big Chill 2011.",

Pooley has been bridging the gap between techno and house, creating tracks such as the massive 'Celtic Cross' and 'Chord Memory' on the [l=Force Inc.

Ian has also remixed for [a=Daft Punk], [a=The Cardigans], [a=The Beloved], [a=Green Velvet], [a=Modjo], [a=Nick Holder] and many more. By refusing to pigeonhole his sound, Pooley records have graced the record boxes of DJs as diverse as [a=Dave Clarke], [a=Justin Robertson], [a=Dave Angel], [a=Judge Jules] and [a=Terry Farley]. Recently, Ian recorded two albums for  [l=V2 Records, Inc.]; \"Meridian\" was a classic Pooley album, choc full of tech-house and including the \"What's Your Number\" as remixed by [a=Jazzanova] and [a=Bob Sinclar]. Ian released his second LP for V2 in 2000; 'Since Then' saw Ian move in a more housier, latin direction and spawned the hit single '900 Degrees'.",

  "profile": "D*Note's blend of Ambient, Nu-Jazz, Drum & Bass, House and rare groove springs from Matt Winn (Matt Wienevski) and musical friends consisting of keyboard player [a115515] who records as [a2649], guitarist Keith Osbourne, and others. Vocalists have included [a14920], [a126446], [a19738] of [a14449], [a242942] and more. Other collaborators include scratching from Charlie Lexton as [a760], rappers [a22278] and [a276136]. The debut album [r=24317] had 4 singles, each of which enjoyed good reviews in their day. [r=44657] built on the energy of the debut and included highlights such as the title track, Iniquity Worker and [r=44664] with notable performance by vocalist [a126446].  To avoid confusion with the celebrity [a310446], Anderson now goes by P.Y. Anderson. Anderson also contributed to their eponymous 1997 album [r=58445]  moving distinctly towards a house sound with her vocals delivering passion and power in the anthem [r=524913].  [a1096] and [a962] provided top-notch remixes. [r=160143] of 2002 continued in the house dance direction. The sixth D*Note album is more thoughtful and deep.  [r=1784742] arrived in 2006 featuring Beth Hirsch; who is well known for her vocals on the first [a2770] album [r=41970].  Laguna features a version of [a90233]'s Edith and the Kingpin among others.  It includes several covers described by Winn as \"hidden gems, the sort of things that music lovers love finding.... an attempt to use the distinctive D*Note sound and marry it to strong American songs, connecting 70s folk rock with drum& bass.\" Matt Winn has also made several short films. [r=160144] is one of his soundtracks.  He also directed [url=http://www.january2ndthemovie.com]January 2nd, the movie[/url]. ___________________________________________________",

Musicians who took part in this project include Vincent Montana Jr., Roy Ayers, George Benson, Jocelyn Brown, Tito Puente, and members of the Salsoul Orchestra. The self-titled album released under the name Nuyorican Soul in 1996 included original tracks as well as cover versions of songs by the performers with which the duo was working, such as \"Sweet Tears\" (Roy Ayers), and \"Runaway,\" originally sung by Loleatta Holloway with the Salsoul Orchestra, here sung by India and featuring musicians from the original recording of 1977. MAW has a vast history as remixers, having reproduced tracks for various acts both inside and outside the world of dance music. Some of the artists remixed by the two producers include Michael Jackson, Madonna, Donna Summer, Gus Gus, Jody Watley, Janet Jackson, Jamiroquai, Earth Wind& Fire, and Stephanie Mills.",

  "realname": "Todd Edwards",
  "profile": "UK Garage/House producer from New Jersey born in 1973. The sound of Todd Edwards is characterised by a hypnotic collage of short cut-up samples over swung US garage beats and lively disco flavoured basslines. He started his musical career around 1992-93. Influenced by [a=Marc Kinchen], whose 'MK' remixes featured vocal reconstructions ('Push The Feeling On' by [a=Nightcrawlers], 'Can You Forgive Her' by the [a=Pet Shop Boys] among others). Credited as one of the godfathers of UK speed garage, Edwards is also a committed Christian and often mention 'Jesus' and 'God' as his primary sources of inspiration. He has been an example for a lot of artists, from [a=MJ Cole], to [a=Daft Punk] and [a=Akufen]. Todd has created remixes for hundreds of artists like [a=Wildchild], [a=St Germain], [a=Nicole J McCloud], [a=Mad Moses], [a=Robin S.], [a=Dimitri From Paris], and [a=Benjamin Diamond]. His way of work is to cut up between 50 to 75 samples (especially gospel, R&B, disco flavoured ones) and apply them in various patterns with the actual vocals on top. Sometimes, small 'hidden' messages are heard throughout his tracks. They commonly refer to 'Jesus' and love. According to him, the weirdest sample he used was his father's voice on 'Saved My Life' (1995). His own releases were generally praised: \"Prima Edizione\" (1999), the \"Full On\" and \"New Trends Sounds\" series contributed to his success.",

  "profile": "One of the second wave of influential Chicago house producers and a member of the vanguard of late-'90s American house producers, DJ Sneak wasn't born in the Windy City but began listening to house soon after his family arrived from Puerto Rico in the early '80s. Because he could speak no English, Sneak gravitated to instrumental music (as well as graffiti art), and became inspired by Chicago legends such as [a=Marshall Jefferson] and [a=DJ Pierre]. Many of those early innovators had left Chicago for the East Coast by the late '80s, when Sneak was ready to start in the business; by 1992, however, [a=Cajmere] had begun a resurgence in the city's classic sound by starting up [l=Cajual Records]. Sneak aided in the revolution with a series of singles on Cajual's sister label, the harder-oriented [l=Relief Records]. Besides other productions for Strictly Rhythm, Henry St., ZYX, 83 West and Feverpitch (several of which feature [a=Armand Van Helden] on co-production, building on the Latin vibes of their heritage), DJ Sneak has also released mix compilations including 1996's Kinky Trax Collection and the following year's Buggin' Da Beats. Founder of the independent vinyl labels [l=Defiant] (1993), [l=Magnetic] (2001) and [l=Oomph] (2002) as well as [l=Leg] (1995) for promo releases plus digital only labels [l=Sneaks House] (2008) and [l=Sneak Tip Music] (2008). In [s]1995[/s] 2002 he opened his own record store called \"Sneak Beats\" on queen Street near Bathurst in Toronto (Canada) which sold underground house music on Vinyl and CDs from their store and by mail order. It closed down approximately 10 years later.",

  "profile": "Tore Andreas \"Erot\" Kroknes, who passed away in 2001 at the age of just 23, was one of the house scene's most promising artists in the late 90's and early 00's. His pioneering deep, dubby sound was well documented on releases such as \"Song For Annie\" and remixes for artists like Bertine Zetlitz, DK, Kings of Convenience and Mental Overdrive, and he also produced the classic pop single \"The Greatest Hit\" for his girlfriend Annie. Erot was also an important figure in the music scene in his home town Bergen, DJing alongside Bjørn Torske on clubs such as Agora and Kennel and contributing extensively to the renowned Tellé label; among other things, he was their in-house designer, and the Tellé logo and all the early sleeves were done by him (as well as loads of logos  and posters for other Norwegian artists). Tore suffered from heart problems from birth, and tragically, this eventually demanded his life; in April 2001, he passed away after a prolonged illness. Stephan Grieder of the Svek label said to burntblue.com: \"Tore was the only guy I ever asked to do remixes for Svek. He was so original in the way he did things and with his sound. He had such a big future, and we were all very shocked. He was just starting to produce his own music rather than just doing remixes, and it was just the beginning for him. It was very sad\". His friend and colleague Bjørn Torske said this in an interview: \"Tore wasn't only a close friend, but also a tremendous resource, both design-wise and musically. The process of making the sleeves, for example, has become so much more demanding now. All the knowledge and courage Tore had was an asset we don't have anymore. Without him, Tellé would never have existed\".",

  "realname": "Orgy",
  "profile": "ORGY emerged in the Goth music scene in 1998 with their incredible remake of ‘Blue Monday’. The track sold over 1 million copies and built a worldwide audience for the brand. In late 2005, after the release of the D1 Music and Associates Punk Statik Paranoia PSP and their D1 Music /DLC Records Independent “TRANS GLOBAL SPECTACLE” DVD promotional tour the band went on a hiatus to work on their side projects. In 2011, after seven years of demand from fans for new music and a tour, founding member Jay Gordon (vocals) decided it was time to kick things back up and begin recording and touring again in support of ORGY’s fans. Born in San Francisco, CA, Jay Gordon was heavily influenced by music from a young age. After playing bass for several years and working as a producer and engineer on several albums (including Coal Chamber’s self-titled album and others), Jay was introduced to four other musicians who, with him, would eventually form ORGY. After establishing themselves in the scene, the band was noticed by Korn vocalist Jonathan Davis and signed to Elementree/Reprise records. 1998-2000 Orgy’s primary release, 1998's Candyass, turned out to be a vast success, mainly fueled by the band’s wildly-popular cover of ‘Blue Monday’ and their initial single, ‘Stitches’. Each single saw several remixes, some of which were produced by Jay Gordon himself (a trend fans came to expect with ORGY's following single releases). In 2000, ORGY unleashed their second complete album, Vapor Transmission, with ‘Fiction (Dreams in Digital)’ and ‘Opticon’ chosen as the singles. 2000-2005 After the release of Vapor Transmission, ORGY left Elementree/Reprise under cordial circumstances. In 2002, Jay Gordon presented the song ‘Slept So Long’ for the Queen of the Damned movie soundtrack. Jay Gordon and ORGY appeared on additional movie soundtracks including Scream 3, Not Another Teen Age Movie and Zoolander, the latter featuring the previously unreleased song ‘Faces’. In 2003, Jay Gordon started his own independent record label, D1 Music, and released the band’s third album, Punk Statik Paranoia, in 2004 which sold over 150,000 units independently and their Trans Global Spectacle DVD was released in 2005 also sold slightly over 9,000 units. Shortly after these releases, ORGY announced an indefinite hiatus. Mid-hiatus, Jay Gordon kept busy with producing, engineering, composing and mixing music, adding to his already substantial list of credits (including Coal Chamber, Crazy Town, Linkin Park, and more). He also leant his voice to various characters for the computer game ‘Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines’. Jay also has a DJ side project Kill-O-Watt. 2011-NOW After deciding to reform the band due to the demands of rabid ORGY fans, Jay found himself with the task of finding new members due to past members being busy with other projects. First, Jay selected North Carolina native and guitarist Carlton Bost to join the ranks of ORGY. Carlton is known for his previous synth guitar work in art-rock band Deadsy, as well as for being the current guitar player for classic synth band Berlin. Other bands Carlton has been a member of, or played for, include The Dreaming, Lunarclick, 16 Volt, Tim Skold, and his own solo project Shades of Scar. Additionally, he works as a producer, writer, and re-mixer for various other artists. ORGY Bassist, studio musician and live session performer Nic Speck came to Los Angeles via upstate New York and Miami, FL. Nic has played with a number of Los Angeles artists including George Lynch, Run Run Run and Tranzk. Multi-instrumentalist and ORGY drummer Bobby Amaro is best known as the hard hitting drummer NUDE and he has been a top rated studio drummer for years. Bobby has been filling in for Jamie Miller who recently got married and Bobby plays so good that the guys want to keep him. More to come on him soon... Our newest member is Multi talented Guitarist / Bass player Creighton Emrick. Ashburn decided to pursue his production career and found his replacement. Creighton was with Vegas in space and a host of rock bands in LA and Ohio. He adds another layer of unique synth guitar sounds and melodies. With these new members joining and combining their respective resumes to build a new and improved band, ORGY was transformed and set to reestablish themselves in the hard rock and metal scene. The band’s new website, www.orgymusic.com was launched in early-2012 in conjunction with their first tour in 7 years Bad Blood 2012 Tour. In September 2012 they released their first single and music video in seven years, ‘Grime of the Century’ on D1 Music/ Riot Media, which is available for streaming now at www.grimeofthecentury.com. In late 2012, the band ventured out on the “Bad Blood” Tour. In early 2013, the band announced a full North American headline run with support from Vampires Everywhere and Davey Suicide. The band continues to work on music for an upcoming full-length. ORGY's WIDE AWAKE AND DEAD TOUR closing show at the world famous Whisky. What an amazing night with the best crowd of great people having a good time!! 2014 ORGY has been working on music over the past 2 years. This is the first single release from ORGY in 2014 is titled: Wide Awake and Dead and is a musical collaboration written by Carlton Bost, Bobby Amaro, Nic Speck Creighton Emrick and Jay Gordon. Carlton has been writing some great new stuff and the guys chose this as the first single. The new sound for ORGY has great lyrics, melodies, and guitars.

  "realname": "Peter Rauhofer",
  "profile": "One of the most popular alias of [a=Peter Rauhofer] in the 1990's. At first, Rauhofer used different aliases to release his music. 'Unique' (1991) was first released under the names [a=Danube Dance] (a name he took from a compilation project of the same name released on [l=GiG Records]), [a=Unique (16)] and [a=Saxmachine]. These projects all featured the vocals of [a=Kim Cooper]. In 1992, a remix of 'Unique' and the single 'Let Me Be Your Underwear' began to be played in Europe and in North America. Both tracks became instant club hits. The year later, Rauhofer continued the success story with 'Take A Ride' featuring the vocal talents of [a=Connie Harvey] and [a=Jocelyn Brown]. Finally, in 1994/95, he decided to regroup all these projects under the name of Club 69. The first album 'Adults Only' featured all the previous hits and many new singles such as 'Diva', 'Warm Leatherette' (a House cover of the [a=Grace Jones] disco hit), 'Sugar Pie Guy' and 'Fantasy'. Club 69 came back in 1997 with the single 'Drama' and full album 'Style' which also included a collaboration with [a=Suzanne Palmer]. Rauhofer also used his Club 69 alias as a remixer and became very famous by remixing popular artists such as [a=Madonna], [a=Cher], [a=Funky Green Dogs], [a=Danny Tenaglia], [a=Depeche Mode], [a=Soft Cell]  and many, many others. His serie 'Club 69 Future Mix' went on to be released on two full mixed albums. In recent years, Rauhofer seems to have moved on his 'Club 69' moniker to release tracks and remixes under his own real identity. 'Unique' was covered by [a=Lisa Unique] in 1999. On May 7th, 2013, Peter Rauhofer lost his battle with brain cancer. According to his manager, Angelo Russo, on his Facebook page: \"Today the music industry has lost one of its true heroes. With a heavy heart I must now report that Peter Rauhofer has lost his battle with brain cancer. He passed quietly today and is survived by his mother, Helga, who resides in Austria. She will transport Peter back home to his final resting place there, but to all that knew Peter, his heart will always be in New York City. It makes me sad, not only that I have lost a friend, but that the world has lost an amazing talent and that future generations will never get to understand the magic that Peter created night after night all over the world. He is gone too soon but we will always have the vast body of music that Peter left for us. Through his music, Peter will live forever. The brightest stars always burn out too soon. Peter, you were loved and you will be terribly missed. Goodbye my friend. Please rest in peace knowing that you have brought so much joy to so many of us. I ask that his true fans keep his legacy alive by sharing his music with anyone who may not have had the opportunity to experience it for themselves.\"",

Later that year, he formed the sub-label [l=Relief Records] mostly for instrumental tracks by himself and others. Besides releases from [a=DJ Sneak], [a=Gemini] and [a=Paul Johnson], Green Velvet figured on many of the early Relief singles, including its first, \"Preacher Man\" as well as \"Flash\" (also released on the British label [l=Open]), \"The Stalker\" and 1997's \"Answering Machine.\" Jones began to supplement his Green Velvet DJing schedule with quasi-live gigs as well, and released his first LP in 1999. His self-titled release on F-111 one year later compiled a dozen of his earlier club hits, and the proper sophomore production album \"Whatever\" appeared in 2001 on his own Relief label.",

  "name": "Bob Sinclar",
  "realname": "Christophe Le Friant",
  "profile": "Born: 10 May 1969 in Douarnenez, Brittany, France. Grammy Award-nominated French record producer, house music DJ& remixer, and owner of the label [l=Yellow Productions]. The second name of this stage name, is pronounced \"Sinclair\" (like British computer/engineering brand named after Sir Clive Sinclair), and is often misspelt like this on releases and in publications. Noted French house svengali, head honcho of ultra-hip independent label Yellow Productions, and responsible of [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mighty+Bop,+The]The Mighty Bop[/url] project. Chris lives in Le Marais, the gay quarter of Paris, the city in which he learnt to play his trade as a funk, rap and French hip-hop DJ in 1986, when he was 18. Chris 'Le French Kiss' got the name Bob Sinclar from a French spy movie (\"Le Magnifique\" directed by Philippe de Broca) and first adopted, to a certain extent, the attitude portrayed by the character in the film. In 1998, the release of Sinclar's first album \"Paradise\" sparked a storm of controversy. [a=Thomas Bangalter]'s song \"Gym Tonic\", which was included on the album without Bangalter's consent, caused legal issues when it used an illegal sample of [a=Jane Fonda]. However, in 2000, Sinclar's second opus \"Champs Élysées\" confirmed his success with hits such as \"I Feel For You\" and \"Darlin' \". Other releases from that period includes his collaboration with Disco artist [a=Cerrone] for a compilation of remixes, and the popular Africanism series, which was more deep house oriented. Dropping the original concept of \"Bob Sinclar\" after that, the release of \"III\" (2003) and of \"Western Dream\" (2006) established him as a popular/commercial DJ. His remixing skills are notable, as he worked for artists such as [a=Ian Pooley], [a=Jamiroquai], [a=Dimitri From Paris], [a=Moby], [a=Fused], and [a=Madonna].

His career began when he was 19 years old with his first residency at Kaboom!. Kaboom! led to his 8-year (and still going strong) residency at Red Dog’s \"Boom Boom Room\", one of the longest running nights in Chicago club history. Drawing from a wide spectrum of musical tastes (Latin Jazz, Jazz, Hip Hop, R&amp; B, Salsa, Meringue, House, Disco and Funk) and influenced by Chicago's DJ legends (Frankie Knuckles, Ralphi Rosario, Farley \"Jackmaster\" Funk, and Edward \"Get Down\" Crosby), Lego pursued his musical passion. In '95, Lego to completed a remix for a Donna Blakely song which made it to #1 on the International dance Music Charts. Since then he has claimed three Billboard hits remixing Ralphie Rosario/Donna Blakely collaboration, \"Take Me Up\" and \"Do You Like The Way That It Feels\" and Rosario's 1998 romp, \"Wanna Give It Up\" featuring Disco legend Linda Clifford. In 1999 he produced the E.P \"Flava In Ya Ear\" on Afterhours which included international hits \"El Ritmo De Verdad\" and \"When I'm With You.\" Both tracks quickly became anthems for that year's club season in Ibiza. The EP hit #1 on the International Dance Music Charts and still remains the best selling release in the label's history. When he’s not touring, you can see him live Monday nights at Chicago's Red Dog at Damen and Milwaukee.",

Now out of print, this was to be a first in a series of well received singles for a variety of respected labels including [l=Silver Network], [l=Classic], [l=Seasons Recordings], [l=Tweekin Records], and [l=Aesoteric Records]. Their first single for Classic, \"Wiggle While We Work\" featured the seminal track \"Mouth\" which was comprised entirely of vocal snippets from the dynamic duo. A remix EP of \"Mouth\" (also on Classic) presented new interpretations by [a=Pépé Bradock] and [a=Greens Keepers] and brought international recognition to Iz and Diz's production. The track was featured on Radio 1 in London and licensed by worldwide heavyweights such as Giles Peterson among many others. Not limiting themselves to peak time house cuts, the team produces a wide range of music for a myriad of times and places. From chilled-out midtempo cuts, to driving disco tinged floor fillers, Iz and Diz have garnered respect from DJ's around the world, with support from [a=Derrick Carter], [a=Mark Farina], [a=Kenny Hawkes], [a=Luke Solomon], [a=DJ Heather], [a=J.T. Donaldson], [a=Lance DeSardi], [a=DJ Sneak] and many more.",

  "profile": "Chicago-born Juan Lopez grew up in the predominately Hispanic Pilsen neighborhood where he was influenced by music at an early age. Soon after his high school years, he traded playing guitar in rock and funk bands for home studio technology that allowed him the freedom to produce his own music without the confines and frustrations that playing in a band presented. Around this time Johnny began his career as a DJ at some of the first underground \"house\" parties in Chicago, and in '88 he landed a residency at Smart Bar with Mark Farina. Three years later he turned a potentially devastating incident into a source of motivation to focus on his career as a producer and began to record for Moonshine, Radikal Fear and the world-renowned Cajual Records. He has produced a number of Billboard hits, remixed the likes of Justin Timberlake, Gloria Estefan, KD Lang and Donna Blakely (just to name a few), and has released records on just about every house label worth listening to. His outstanding musical accomplishments have attracted worldwide attention to this humble artist, and his ongoing musical endeavors continue to play a major role in defining the past, present and future of house music.",

  "profile": "To be a successful house music producer, you have to make tracks that DJs want to play. And, to be a good DJ, you have to play music that inspires people to move their asses. Simple in theory, but not in execution. Wally Callerio’s inherent ability to do both and to do both well has served him justly over the last two decades, establishing him as an artist with talent, vision and staying power in a genre that has navigated tumultuous highs, lows and growing pains in between. With over 20 years of experience behind the decks and in the studio under his belt, Callerio has put out a remarkable 250 original tracks and remixes on over 50 labels worldwide. Most recently, his music has been released on such respected heavyweights as Defected, Cajual, Farris Wheel Recordings, Grin Music and Sampled Recordings. In addition, Callerio has earned accolades under his alter ego moniker Poncho Warwick, consistently ranking as a top annual pick for best chillout artist on Beatport. In his role as Music Supervisor for “Unconscious Therapy,” a documentary released in April 2016 that chronicles the rise and evolution of house music via the lens of Frankie Knuckles and his fellow innovators, Callerio took on the crucial responsibility of licensing and curating the film’s soundtrack. He is also a featured artist in the documentary, alongside Mark Farina, Derrick Carter, Masters at Work and a bevy of other house icons. Possessed of an entrepreneurial spirit and willingness to embrace change, Callerio has earned and enjoyed enduring success as both an artist and label-owner. Los Angeles-based Dufflebag Recordings, which Callerio launched in 1998, has been churning out deep and funky grooves suffused with soulful vocals since its inception, and the label boasts an impressive roster of artists that includes Demarkus Lewis, Manjane, Alysha Kid, Corduroy Mavericks, JT Donaldson, Natural Rhythm, Ryan Truman and R&B legend Jon B. under his moniker Jah Ques. For Callerio, house music still holds just as much untapped potential as it did when he first cut his teeth on the genre in the early nineties — and he’s never been one to rest on his laurels when his passion is at stake and opportunity abounds. “I don’t try to predict the future of house, I try to give it my imagination and push with my music,” Callerio says. “I try to inspire people into making and playing the right stuff.” That drive and openness have kept Callerio prolific, relevant and on top of his game — and better still, are a promise of many good things yet to come.",

Together with [a=Kid Alex] and [a=Daniel Klein] they strengthened these two Hamburg labels, which were basically supported by [a=Mousse T.], Sebastian Döring and Thorsten Freese produced under many different names and synonyms, whereas \"Knee Deep\" and \"Knee Deep Brothers\" were well-known.

For opening the US market they started at first their successful work for \"Look At You\" artists, like the [a=Pound Boys].

  "profile": "Shy FX crashed the British pop charts in mid-1994 with \"Original Nuttah\", one of the most infectious Ragga-Jungle anthems of all time and quickly became one of Jungle's most respected producers. Born in London, Andre Williams debuted on S.O.U.R. Records (Sound Of The Underground) with two singles, \"Gangsta Kid\" and \"Sound Of The Beast\", in 1994. His third for the label, \"Original Nuttah,\" perfectly epitomized Jungle's growing Ragga-Ruffneck style, with a light-speed rhythm track and rude-boy scatting from [a=UK Apachi]. Almost immediately after its release, the single ignited dance clubs, flew out of the stores, and eventually made the British charts. Shy FX started his own [l=Ebony Recordings] label soon after, releasing more classic Jungle tunes like \"The Message\" and \"Wolf\". His 1997 \"Bambaata\" was hailed as tune of the year. Shy started a couple of offshoots such as Ivory (catering for no-nonsense rollers) and Naughty But Nice (for the funkier end of his productions). But this is his collaborative work with [a=T.Power] that had so far the biggest impact, mixing their highly credible brand of drum and bass with a strong pop sensibility, with \"Shake Ur Body\" in 2001 – released on EMI subsidiary [l=Positiva] – that made him a household name. It was followed by an album on [l=FFRR] \"Set It Off\" the following year. Shy FX decide to fold all his label to concentrate on a new Digital Soundboy venture in 2005, releasing so far a Shy FX and T Power album \"Diary Of A Digital Soundboy\", as well a providing a choice platform for promising young artists such as Benny Page and Visionary. Grandson of [a=Count Shelly].",

  "profile": "The duo of Jay Hurren and Alex Banks defined the easy-rolling two-step of Moving Shadow Records during the late '90s with their recordings as E-Z Rollers, after developing hardcore breakbeats earlier in the decade as JMJ & Richie and Hyper On Experience. Both were originally involved in the mid-'80s rare-groove and hip-hop scene around their native East Anglia, promoting shows and DJing as well. They moved into house as well after the rave explosion, and while Banks increasinly concentrated on production work in his home studio during the early '90s, Hurren continued to mix at events, usually billed as JMJ. The duo began recording (separately at first) after meeting emerging jungle don L.T.J Bukem -- Banks with Hyper On Experience and Hurren with JMJ& Richie (as well as the solo project Parallel World). Hurren and Banks' various singles for Rob Playford's Moving Shadow and Bukem's Good Looking -- \"Montana\" and \"Universal Horn\" as JMJ & Richie, \"Thunder Grip\" and \"Lords of the Null Lines\" as Hyper-On Experience -- helped write the template for smooth drum'n'bass with plenty of jazz texture but swift rhythms to keep the vibes moving in clubs. After meeting up with vocalist Kelly Richards at one of their gigs, Hurren and Banks decided to form E-Z Rollers around the threesome. Their debut album Dimensions of Sound appeared in mid-1996, followed by several additional singles for Moving Shadow and the full-length follow-up Weekend World. Hurren and Banks have also worked on production for Foul Play and Peshay.",

  "realname": "Jim Baker & Phil Aslett",
  "profile": "Audio visions of the future, whether galloping day-glo space odysseys or crumbling Philip K Dick-esque dystopian nightmares, have been front and centre within electronic music since near its origins. And although recent years have seen artists from multiple genres looking misty-eyed to halcyon years, mawkishly imagining the 'death of rave' or piecing together second hand memories beneath eighth hand Amen breaks, in suburban St Albans in the mid 1990s it was a wildly different story. Two young teenagers, Jim Baker and Phil Aslett, rigged up cheap synths and rudimentary samplers and started making the most future-facing electronic music around. Forming close artistic allegiances with fellow St Albans drum& bass maestro Photek, Source Direct focused on sweeping pads, haunting melodies, chest-crushing subs and the most twisted breakbeat work imaginable. They quickly found their tracks being played regularly by LTJ Bukem and, a year or so later, the whole family of DJ's that surrounded the Metalheadz stable. Although the pair only released a few 12\"s on 'headz itself, their style of production was intrinsically bound up with the whole 'scene within a scene' that surrounded that iconic label. DJs like Kemistry & Storm, Loxy, Doc Scott and, of course, Goldie regularly played the duo's work at the Sunday Blue Note sessions and also the countless label tours that were undertaken all over the world at the time. This was music steeped in dark romance; brooding, foreboding and cold, unbearably tense. Check 'Stonekiller' – a colossus of clammy-backed fear, like being stalked through the twisting, flicker-lit basement alleyways of Hong Kong's dilapidated Chungking Mansions by machete-wielding gangsters, through the kitchens with the live hens, past the gambling dens and barbers. Truth be told it's a bloody nightmare of a track, and one that illustrates the fact that, though often black as night, Source Direct never gave into the base nosebleed aesthetics that came to dominate drum& bass just a few years later. Their music was beautiful and, as they scarcely left the studio and were uninterested in pursuing the breakneck DJ schedule of many of their contemporaries, they had the time they needed to craft it to perfection. But although Source Direct were, and remain, unsurpassed in their ability to conjure dark audio visions, their sound was not one-dimensional. 1996's 'Secret Liaison'/'Complexities' 12\", for example, remains one of the most beautifully powerful explorations of time-stretched amen bliss put to vinyl. This was music that took time. It is rare to find a Source Direct tune below six minutes; most surpass eight. The 12\"s rolled on through the late 90s, alongside genre-defining music from like-minded compadres Hidden Agenda, Digital, Ed Rush& Optical, the No U Turn crew and Dillinja. But, as is so often the case with young partnerships, things turned sour once major label pressure and money entered the equation - and in those days the majors were taking a big interest in drum & bass. Tensions came to a head over a deal with Virgin, Aslett and Baker eventually parted ways in 2000. With a back catalogue such as theirs however, interest has only grown since. A new generation of drum& bass producers, including Blocks and Escher, Ulterior Motive and Om Unit, to name but a few, have drawn audible inspiration from the beauty, cinematic power and ambition of the original Source Direct sound. Outside of that genre, many other artists have also been vocal in their appreciation of the duo's work, not least those affiliated to the Blackest Ever Black stable, such as Raime. Jim Baker has recently started DJing again as Source Direct and, as anybody who has seen him play in recent years will attest, it is an absolute riot, drawing on classic era jungle, hardcore and all manner else, succinctly joining the dots between styles and eras. However, this is no nostalgia trip - Jim has also recently begun making music again after a near decade-long hiatus.",

  "profile": "Over the last decade, South London-based Larry Cons has amassed a vast discography on the Drum & Bass scene’s most respected labels. Whilst his releases date back to the start of 1998, his history as an accomplished musician dates back to early childhood. Having studied 5 instruments from a young age, Larry has worked on projects and bands in several genres, perhaps most prominently as a guitarist in numerous Jazz and Funk bands, including his own eight-piece outfit ‘Octane’. Whilst the home for most of his music has been the legendary Moving Shadow imprint, he has also had an array of highly-acclaimed releases on Metalheadz, V Recordings, Renegade Hardware, Subtitles, Violence Recs, Audio Couture, ill.skillz Recs, Intercom, Rugged Vinyl, as well as two of his own labels, Thunderous Audio (co-owned with Kontrol) and Momentum Music (co-owned with TeeBee). The debut Calyx album on Moving Shadow; ‘No Turning Back’ was hailed by many as the highlight of 2005. Featuring 6 solo tracks, 4 collaborations (with TeeBee, Gridlok, and ill.skillz), and remixes by Dom & Roland and Hive & Gridlok (remixing together for the first time!), every track gained massive DJ support and the album was in such high demand that three represses had to be made in the first 6 months following its release. Given Larry’s well-established reputation and strengths as a DJ, it’s not suprising that the release of the album was followed by a deluge of bookings for an album world tour that continued for the rest 2005; two U.S. tours, two Australian tours, and countless European dates ensured that the Calyx sound spread far and wide. 2007 proved to be a phenomenal year with the launch of a new label from Calyx& TeeBee, marking its first release with not just a 12’ or an E.P., but with an entire album of Calyx & TeeBee collaborations released on 4-piece Vinyl and CD. The Anatomy LP topped sales charts for weeks on end and was followed by a massive album World Tour of back-to-back Calyx & TeeBee sets. Calyx& TeeBee are now working on their second collaborative album – an LP which will see them branch into new genres with one half of the LP being DnB and the other half comprising a wide range of styles. Expect a vinyl triple-pack of 6 DnB cuts, and all 20 tracks released on double-CD and mp3. In addition to their ventures into new styles of music, Calyx& TeeBee have been pushing for more of their joint sets to feature 6 decks and 2 mixers, with both DJ’s in action simultaneously. They first performed with this setup at a legendary event in Moscow, October 2007. Since then they have made over 30 performances on 6 to 8 decks and 2 mixers. With each gig they have discovered more permutations, possibilities and ideas whilst developing an understanding that generates both spontaneous and choreographed moments. Calyx and TeeBee find it by far the most exciting, enjoyable and expressive way they have ever performed and are now looking to make every joint booking feature this setup. Rest assured, you will never have heard or seen a DnB performance like it!",

  "profile": "1997 saw the release of Decoder’s ‘Decoded EP’. The release went on to become one of the most played tracks in the country’s drum and bass clubs and achieved press recognition with a number eighteen placing in N.M.E’s ‘Vibes Singles Of The Year’ chart. Suddenly Decoder was appearing across various labels. Breakbeat Culture, Tech Itch Recordings, Hard Leaders, 31 Records and Audio Couture were some of the labels that were to feature Decoder’s patented and increasingly popular style. If writing his own music wasn’t enough, Decoder was also supplying Peshay with his much vaunted production skills. His name appears all over Peshay’s ‘Miles From Home’, an album that has gone on to sell well over 100,000 copies worldwide. Pure testament to Decoder’s production skills. Darren’s next release, the ‘Encrypted EP’, released in 1998, peaked at number three in Fab& Groove’s ‘Rollers Top Ten’. The ‘Encrypted EP’ along with ‘Headlock’, ‘Deception’ and Decoder’s collaboration with Mark Caro, ‘EKO’ ensured the artist was here to stay. By the end of the year Decoder had ammased enough material for an album release. ‘Dissection’, the album, appeared on Hard Leaders and went on to receive critical acclaim throughout the industry. Muzik magazine labelled the album as being “Wracked with quality”, Mix Mag said that it provided “Proof that there is still a bright future for Drum & Bass albums” and Wax titled it as “One of the more interesting long-players to surface this year\". Throughout all this, Decoder was responsible for the groundbreaking remixes of tracks like Photek’s ‘Rings Around Saturn’, Adam F’s ‘Dirty Harry’ and Alan McGee’s ‘The Chemical Pilot’. Naturally Decoder’s awesome talents needed another outlet to allow him to realise his true potential, and with that came his latest project entitled ‘Kosheen’. Most notably Kosheen has been responsible for the track ‘Hide You’. A song that has occupied most sound systems across the country and reached a number one chart position in several european territories. (Taken from the BS1 Records website)",

  "name": "Dillinja",
  "realname": "Karl Francis",
  "profile": "There are few producers on the drum’n’bass scene who are as respected and revered as Dillinja. With his trademark combination of dirty stomach-churning basslines and tighter than tight beats, his reputation has been secured as one of the most influential producers in drum’n’bass history, as well as one of the scene’s most called-upon remixers, having worked with everyone from David Bowie to Bjork and Basement Jaxx. A true connoisseur of sound, Dillinja’s mighty 96k Valve Sound System is recognised the world over as being second to none. Dillinja was reared on a musical diet of funk, jazz, reggae and rare groove, genres which proved to influence him enormously, but it was the 1980s hip hop and electro explosion which really captured his heart. His hunger for hip-hop was well satisfied in South London, as local parks hosted free events where hip-hop, soul, rare groove and reggae could be consumed in vast quantities. The influence of these events on Dillinja, where the likes of King Tubby’s Hi Fi and Jah Shaka made their presence felt with their mighty earth-shaking reggae sound systems, was huge. Dillinja began to shadow a local guy who had made Jah Shaka’s amps, and not long after, at the age of fifteen, he was making his own custom built amps and bass bins; a hobby that soon became obsession, with his teenage bedroom so full of audio equipment, he had no choice but to put his mattress atop the speaker cabinets and sleep there. However, when the infamous Criminal Justice Bill was introduced, seriously clamping down on sound systems and the events where they were played. Dillinja decided that rather than compromising his system, he would call it a day, sell of its components, and enter the heady world of music production. With musical experience gained at school playing both the drums and violin, Dillinja easily picked up the required skills, hanging around the Digidub Studios in Camberwell to get a feel for the engineering side of the process. He began to furiously produce tracks, so many at one point that he was putting out two releases a week, plunging any money earned straight back into the kitty for mastering and pressing costs, as well as bus and train fares for self-distribution to all the specialist records stores. Dillinja: “I wasn’t making any money for years, I just had such a love for the music. I was knocking tunes together in my room, getting a hundred white labels pressed and running around with them to record shops myself. It was a great learning process and I loved it”. It is an often cited fact that by the age of 23, Dillinja already had 50 releases under his belt. His initial records were all on white label, including his first ever release ‘Tear Off Your Chest’, produced with Batmix, but within a couple of years he went on to form a myriad of labels such as Cybotron, Logic, Target, IQ and Deadly Vinyl, the latter being home to such Dillinja early classics as ‘Sovereign Melody’ and ‘Deadly Deep Subs’. As well as his own label, Dillinja went on to record for many other drum’n’bass labels, including Bryan Gee and Jumpin' Jack Frost’s V Recordings and Philly Blunt labels, Hardleaders, Prototype and Goldie’s pioneering Metalheadz imprint. Dillinja used these labels to show his unique musical versatility; while labels such as Philly Blunt and Lionheart Records showcased some of Dillinja’s more raw jungle based sounds, as in ‘Muthafucka’ and the reggae-fuelled basslines of ‘Lionheart’ (produced with Bert), his seminal 1994 Blade Runner-sampling release ‘The Angels Fell’ was at the helm of the new wave of drum’n’bass encapsulated in the cutting edge Metalheadz sound. It is this fusion of dark basslines and tightly produced beats that has become Dillinja’s trademark sound today, a sound that has resulted in Dillinja being called to remix for the likes of David Bowie, Bjork, Faith No More, Soul II Soul, Basement Jaxx, Amon Tobin, Artful Dodger and Jeru the Damaja. The various aliases under which he has recorded include Trinity, Capone, Cybotron and The Specialist. Dillinja’s introduction to Kevin King aka Lemon D in the mid 1990s through a mutual friend resulted in a partnership which soon gave birth to Valve Recordings in 1997, so named after the old Shaka pre-amps used in reggae sound systems. Starting as it meant to go on, the label’s first release was Dillinja’s brutal ‘Violent Killa’, backed with Lemon D’s ‘12.01’. Test Recordings was set up as a subsidiary label at around the same period – a more anonymous, dancefloor-based label. In between these various releases on his Valve labels, Dillinja signed an album deal with London Records in 2000, a move that resulted in the production of the classic ‘Cybotron’ LP in 2001, an album highly acclaimed by the dance music establishment which cemented Dillinja’s position as one of the true leaders in his field. Nowhere has this been more apparent than with the Valve Sound System. Fed up with playing on second rate club sound systems which they felt didn’t do their tracks justice, Dillinja, utilising his vast knowledge and experience in the field, decided, with Lemon D, to build his own system – the Valve Sound System – the world’s first sound system designed and built specifically for drum’n’bass and its frequencies of deep bass which were all too often ignored by most club systems. The mighty 96k Valve Sound System made its mind blowing club debut at London’s Fabric nightclub in May 2001, and since then it has extensively toured the UK, with plans for the system to be taken overseas in the near future. In May 2002, Dillinja co-produced Valve Recordings’ debut album ‘Big Bad Bass’ with Lemon D, an LP which aimed to reflect the ethos of the Valve Sound System and included dancefloor smashers such as Dillinja’s ‘Thugged Out Bitch’ and Valve Sound System anthem ‘It Ain’t Too Loud’. ‘The Killa-Hertz’ followed in September 2003, including a Valve documentary and cover art by legendary photographer Dennis Morris, responsible for taking some of the most iconic photos of Bob Marley, the Sex Pistols and King Tubby, among others. A retrospective LP ‘‘My Sound 1993 – 2004’ was released in 2004, featuring some of the biggest tracks from the Dillinja back catalogue, including ‘Acid Track’, ‘The Angels Fell’ and ‘Friday’. As head of Valve Recordings, he has continued to find and develop new talent for the label and has commissioned several compilation albums, including cuts from the likes of TC, High Contrast and Breakage. Dillinja is currently working on new material for his Valve imprint, as well as touring extensively with the Valve Sound System and DJing internationally.",

  "profile": "Manchester’s techno pioneers were formed in 1988 when Martin Price, owner of the city’s seminal Eastern Bloc underground record store, teamed up with Graham Massey, formerly of Factory Records’ Biting Tongues and more recently renowned as a producer. The debut EP, Newbuild was cut in collaboration with fellow Mancunian Gerald Simpson. The trio were also responsible for mixing tracks for local artists, including Inspiral Carpets. In 1989 Simpson departed to launch his own vehicle, A Guy Called Gerald, and DJ duo the Spinmasters (Andrew Barker and Darren Partington) were drafted into 808 State. The new quartet cut the Quadrastate EP, a huge club hit, and the single Pacific which crossed over into the national top ten at the tail end of 1989. The timing of their rise to prominence worked in their favour, as the Madchester explosion began dominating the UK music and style press. 808 State were cast alongside the likes of the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays which aroused interest from the rock world and broke down barriers between the indie and dance factions. 808 State signed to ZTT in 1990 and delivered the classic 808:90, which was immediately adopted by the rave generation as a soundtrack to post-gig chill out sessions, as well as becoming a favourite with DJs and rock concert audiences. Additionally, a single, The Only Rhyme That Bites, cut with rapper MC Tunes cruised into the UK top ten in June. Ex:El followed in 1991, and included collaborations with Björk, (then of Sugarcubes) and New Order vocalist Bernard Sumner. In October of that year a US tour was arranged, but Price decided against making the trip, preferring to stay in Manchester to encourage and manage local talent, (including Rochdale rappers The Kaliphz) and developing his own musical ideas. 808 State pressed on, recording Gorgeous, which featured Echo and the Bunnymen singer Ian McCulloch and samples from some inspired sources such as The Jam, UB40 and sound bites from Star Wars. The band also delivered a string of groundbreaking remixes for other artists including David Bowie, Soundgarden and Primal Scream. In 1996, 808 State re-emerged with a new album, the radically experimental Don Solaris, which won the band acclaim from both long-term fans and recent converts. The record’s currency was informed by acid-house and trip-hop, occasionally veering into the in-vogue sounds of jungle and garage, the music du jour of UK clubland. Once more guest vocalists were employed to add colour to the familiar layered sonic textures - James Dean Bradfield (Manic Street Preachers) and Lamb’s Louise Rhodes amongst them – and paved the way for a triumphant homecoming concert to close the commonwealth games, in front of 40,000 people. They also hosted radio shows on Sunset FM& Kiss FM (Manchester).",

Anyone with a negative attitude does my head in\", says Jason, so starting his own label meant he would be in complete control of what he did and who he let in. In winter 1997, Jason and Ola created a Drum 'n' Bass record label called 'East Side'.  Jason has run the label ever since and they have been a solid and successful team.  Most of the artists on the label are from the East Side (of London), although Elementz of Noize are from Newcastle and Majistrate is from Kent. Jason has constructed a team of wicked producers: Embee, Cool Hand Flex, Uncle 22, Majistrate, Shape Shifter, Fate, D.T. and Randall, who along with Kenny Ken, Storm and Fabio play Jason's tunes all the time, on the radio, in clubs and at raves.  Says Jason, \"I don't poach artists, but I'm always on the look out for new music\".  Not only does Jason run East Side, he also runs another Drum 'n' Bass label called 'Fuze'.",

Adam F built a stellar reputation in the hiphop world as a musician and a producer upon emerging in the late '90s. Many in the hiphop and rap communities believe he has the potential to become a master producer like Dr. Dre. By age 15, F was a fan of of early U.S. hiphop and British electronica acts. His melodic sensibilities were sharpened by his love of Lalo Schifrin, Quincy Jones, Bob James and jazz-fusion in general. F developed his skills as a keyboardist and, by the early '90s, he was studying the drum 'n bass foundations of hiphop, electronica and techno. He signed to EMI in the U.K. and his 1998 debut album Colours featured the top 20 hits \"Circles,\" \"Brand New Funk\" and \"Music in My Mind.\" Colours won a Music of Black Origin (MOBO) award in the U.K. as best album. After an 18-month tour with a live band, F proceeded to further trek the globe as a DJ for other artists like Goldie and Jumping Jack Frost. Some of his demos made their way to Def Jam Records, who passed them on to LL Cool J. The rapper immediately loved F's tapes, and he had Adam F. produce \"The G.O.A.T.\" on 2000's G.O.A.T. Featuring James T. Smith: The Greatest of All Time, his first number one album in the U.S. Soon, F started working with the likes of Missy \"Misdemeanor\" Elliott and Lady Luck. Re-focusing on his own career, he spent 18 months recording his 2001 album, KAOS, which includes his own version of \"The G.O.A.T.\" and the anthem \"Smash Sumthin',\" featuring Redman. The recording of KAOS was also filmed for a documentary. Owned the [l=F-Jams] label& [l=Bible Studios]. He is also one of the co-owners of the Dogs On Acid internet D'n'B forum. As a teen he also played keyboards on a U.S. tour for [a=The Moody Blues].",

  "profile": "Born: October 29, 1969, Bristol, England Bristol native Roni Size is one of the U.K. jungle scene's most respected names, with production credits spanning dozens of labels, projects and releases. Size's influence as a producer, label owner, and committed underground magnate figured him as one of the emerging sound's true pioneers. The breakout success of his debut album New Forms finally confirmed his stature and vaulted him to a greater degree of popularity than any drum'n'bass producer. Born to Jamaican immigrant parents, Roni grew up in the Bristolean suburb of St. Andrews (home to Tricky, Massive Attack, and Smith& Mighty), where he learned the fundamentals of hip-hop through the area's sounds systems, house parties, and underground clubs. Expelled from school  Size started dabbling with house and reggae production in the late'80s. He hooked up with labelmates DJ Krust, Suv, and DJ Die at the 1990 Glastonbury Festival, and the four stayed in contact, eventually forming Size's longest running musical commitment to date: his own Full Cycle label. Although hardly popular in the days before ragga (then jump-up) ruled the decks, the crew now counts a number of classics among their credits, including Size's \"It's a Jazz Thing,\" Krust's \"Jazz Note,\" and Reprazent's Reasons for Sharing EP, the crew's first outing through major label subsidiary Talkin' Loud. The success of 1997's New Forms launched Size to the top of the electronica genre, and the Dope Dragon label also continues to rise in the ranks of dubplate hysteria, with tracks from Selector Owoy, Gang Related, and Mask consistently passing muster on most DJ's decks. After a relatively silent 1998, Size returned in 1999 with a new project -- Breakbeat Era, with DJ Die and vocalist Leonie Laws. The trio released Ultra-Obscene in the fall of that year. In 2000, Size returned to the Reprazent project with In the Mode, boasting sit-ins from Method Man and ex-Rage Against the Machine's Zack De La Rocha. His brother was jungle recordings artist [a=4-Tree].",

His releases are mostly within the electronic music genres of drum and bass, Electronica, Hip hop, Braindance and IDM, with a significant jazz influence . His style is often described in the media as very playful. It is comprised of finely chopped, fast rhythms in combination with jazzy bass and synthesizer lines and 8bit sounds (like video game music). In this area he is one of the prominent Japanese musicians of this time. Some of his pieces have been featured on John Peel´s Radio show on BBC Radio 1 and one was later released as an mp3 on the Tribute to John Peel Series, as a free download. In his Live Acts he uses primarily his laptop, MIDI controllers and effects processors.",

He has after that had releases thru labels like [l=Merck] (Miami,US), [l=Rikos Records] (Finland), [l=U-Cover] (Belgium), [l=Inc.us] (Belgium), [l=Zealrecords] (Belgium), [l=Psychonavigation Records] (Ireland), [l=New Speak] (Sweden). Born October 26, 1978 in Helsinki, Esa first became interested in computer music when he was 6. Some of his early favorites were the songs created for C64 games, later modules by such luminaries as Aleksi Eeben, Niko Nyman, Sami Järvinen, and others, on the Commodore Amiga. By 1994, Esa had shifted his musical interests to ambient/idm and has later on flourished as a member of the Helsinki scene, providing music for various netlabels like [l=Monotonik] and [l=Kahvi Collective]. Currently, Esa continues to release thru several international labels and explores new tracks& techniques at his flat in eastern Helsinki. Contact: esaruoho@gmail.com",

Performing and recording gave them a moment of confidence long enough to go out with their own ideas and somehow, there was a friendly 'coup' at the same time as OYC activites slowed down to Kraftwerkian-speed.  Their first inspiration was the idea of Zoviet*France going to a nightclub.  Their first release was \"O Yuki Conjugate + The Sons of Silence=SPOKE\" - a live document of music made with bicycles and electronics, still regarded very fondly by the band, albeit with a slightly rueful sense of not being able to continue combining abstract oddness and more popular idioms so starkly. After a succession of highl-regarded/critically acclaimed releases on the Leaf Label, the band have spent the last few years in the grip of a depressive inertia and frustration at not being able to chuck out the wide variety of musics they love making to a public.  So what's new? October 2003 sees work start on the soundtrack to the feature film \"Shaun of The Dead\", while one of the Sons wonders whether the only way to get stuff released is to die in spectacular fashion.  Maybe so, considering their main interest currently is making music in the Kosmische idiom and the Guitar-powered drone! Well, c'mon - you can't keep yoinking breakbeats for ever can ya?",

  "profile": "This prolific artist has been producing breakbeat, jungle, and drum and bass since the early 90s. The \"Mutant Jazz\" single and the critically acclaimed album \"Self Evident Truth Of An Intuitive Mind\" (both released in 1995) are touted as staple Drum and Bass classics. In 1998, T Power, along with Cris Stevens, formed \"Chocolate Weasel\" and released the single \"Music for Body Lockers\", followed by a funk and hip-hop album called \"Spaghettification\". T Power also collaborated with Shy FX (Andre Williams), both as Ebony Dubsters and Shy FX and T Power.  The duo's 2001 breakthrough track \"Shake Ur Body\" with vocalist Di reached Number 7 hit in the UK Singles Chart.  Released on EMI subsidiary Positiva, it gained widespread support from both club and commercial radio DJs and helped to further popularize drum& bass as a mainstream music genre.  The success of \"Shake Ur Body\" was followed by the duo's album \"Set It Off\", released in 2002 on Pete Tong's label F.F.R.R.. Several EPs and single releases followed; by 2005, Shy FX had made the decision to consolidate his releases onto his own label and founded Digital Soundboy Recordings. In collaboration with T Power, they subsequently released the album Diary of a Digital Sound Boy on 17 October 2005, featuring the songs \"Feelings\", \"On The Run\" and \"Plastic Soul\". Shy FX and T Power also released \"Don't Wanna Know\" featuring Di and MC Skibadee. The song was notably used on the UK television programme Soccer AM as part of the 'Skills Skool' feature. In 2009, T Power reincarnated himself as Mr. Sofalumpkins, an electro/breakbeat/techno DJ, performing live Ableton sets, which consisted of a new sound and original new tracks. In 2013, T Power collaborated with John Rolodex on the single, \"That Jungle Vibe - Featuring Khadija\", which was released on V Records. In late February of 2014, T Power announce that \"The Lazy Nine\", his first album under Marc Royal, is scheduled for release on Adastra Recordings (T Power's own record label) at the end of May.",

Gallon's previous projects have included ambient experimental percussion duo Chemical Plant, Headbutt, and live sample improvisors Fork. Funkturm transmuted from Operation Mind Control, who released one album - Funkturm - on D.O.R. in 1994, as well as three cassette-only releases on the cult Chainsaw label from 1990 to 1993. The debut Funkturm album, Urban Mantras, is 9 tracks of minimalist breakbeats and hypnotic soundscapes. Funkturm takes its name from Berlin's radio tower. The name was chosen because of a fascination with the sounds and textures of international short-wave radio broadcasts. Radio sounds have been used throughout previous releases. A new album - provisionally titled Bon Tempi - is currently in progress, to be released later in 2001. The album is likely to feature more organic textures and instrumentation, heralding a return to the more improvisational nature of previous projects, melded with the hypnotic electronic rhythms and structures of Funkturm / Operation Mind Control work to date. The new material will be previewed on this site throughout the duration of recording. Stay tuned.",

Over the course of his career as Photek, Parkes has developed a sound that is simultaneously individual, innovative and accessible, earning him much respect and popularity amongst critics and music fans alike. The strength of the sound finds foundation in Photek’s incredibly detailed drum programming, which is then augmented by his sophisticated sense for combining abstract sounds with jazz and classic techno influences. Recently Parkes has been more and more active in producing music for film, having worked on a number of scoring projects for upcoming features from his new home base in Los Angeles. His dedication to film scoring is evident, and his perfectionist attention to detail and tireless work ethic are quickly leading him to success in Hollywood.",

  "profile": "(From Fila Brazillia's website): \"In 1990 David 'Man' McSherry and Steve Cobby began to record as Fila Brazillia. Hitherto their collaborations had been infrequent and ultra-spontaneous. Both had maintained positions in conventional bands but needed to trade the constraints of the \"write - rehearse - gig - record\" treadmill for a more fluent, and ultimately enjoyable approach. A nursery period for a music culled from sonic experiments and ideas quickly put to tape emerged. A treatment of all sounds as \"objet trouvé\" and a hobbyist attitude prevailed. When Dave Brennand a.k.a. Porky heard a piece composed on a wet Wednesday, he asked to release it. They happily agreed. As previous unreleased work hadn't warranted anything but comedy monickers - \"Dada Black Sheep\" being one - a name was needed. At that time the media's \"killer dog frenzy\" was in full swing and a breed known as the fila brasiliero was the subject of a debate in the Commons. This was misheard on the radio by Steve, proposed and accepted for the single and eventually the name stuck. The track \"Mermaids\", was Fila Brazillia's first single, released in Spring 1991, and marked the beginning of a decade which saw Fila yield seven highly acclaimed albums and a skip-full of singles on Pork Recordings and over 60 remixes.\" Steve Cobby's current projects (2009) include establishing Steel Tiger Records with Sim Lister; home to J*S*T*A*R*S and The Cutler (Cobby collaborations with Lister and Porky).",

  "profile": "From deep atmospheric soundtrack acid to dark industrial electro-funk and melancholic electronic wave disco, Rude 66 has done it with a Dystopian edge of new wave-futurism. Via noise and EBM in the 80's, Rude 66 landed on Bunker Records in 1993 where, with Unit Moebius and I-f, he defined the acid sound of The Hague: lo-fi acid from the sewer. In 1997 Rude 66, bored with corporate techno and empty distorted acid, evolved his style to dark electro funk. A string of EP’s on leading genre labels like Bunker, Vynalogica, Angelmaker, Crème organisation and Viewlexx established Rude’s name as one of the masters of the dark side of electro-wave, pushing his analogue studio to the limits on already classic tracks like Machine, Black Sabbath, My 909, Overkill and his most recent releases The 1000 year storm and As. For the past 15 years, Rude has perfected a sound that employs everything from early 80’s alternative club music to his own dark acid past, from oldskool electro to Italian soundtracks. Rude’s choice of workhorses (mostly vintage analogue synths and drum machines) and recording methods (still using a big mixing desk and analogue reel-to-reel recording) have resulted in an instantly recognizable signature sound: hard, dense but full of detail and groove and still carrying trace elements of the classic sound of The Hague. As a firm believer in only recording tracks when you have something to say, Rude’s output has never been prolific, but each release has hit the scene hard. Rather than just making tracks for the sake of making tracks, Rude’s music has always had an idea behind it, usually working with themes rooted in the darker side of life. Rude’s tracks have been used, abused, charted and compiled by dj’s like Dave Clarke, Andrew Weatherall, The Hacker, Miss kitten, I-f, Sven Vath and countless others, though his tracks are anything but dj-tracks only made to fill mixes. To Rude it’s very important that his tracks can be enjoyed at home as much as on the dance floor. His signature sound has been applied to a number of remixes for other artists. Rude has run the Vynalogica label for the CEM studio in Amsterdam and has his own weekly radio show at I-f’s Cybernetic Broadcasting System internet radio station. Rude is also a member of the 303 Allstars, a live acid collaboration with Cosmic Force, the Acid Junkies, Zero One and Drifter. Rude 66's acclaimed live shows are intense improvisation workouts featuring mostly analogue equipment. They include live vocals by Rude’s wife Shaunna, and are based loosely on the studio tracks. Rude has dragged his equipment all across the world for over 15 years from small squats to big festivals, and knows like no other how to rock a crowd hard. Billed 'the king of the dark electro-wave death race' by slick promoters, Rude likes his tracks to sound like you're on the red carpet pathway to hell. Dancing.",

  "profile": "June 17, 1961 - January 14, 1999 \"Bryn Jones was not a practicing Muslim and never traveled to the Middle East. His recordings as Muslimgauze, however, qualified him as one of the Western artists most explicitly slanted in favor of the Palestinian liberation movement. Since the Manchester native’s works were instrumental, most of the political statement was inherent in the packaging: witness titles such as [i]Fatah Guerrilla[/I], [i]Return of Black September[/I], [i]Hebron Massacre[/I], [i]Vote Hezbollah[/I], [i]United States of Islam[/I], and [i]The Rape of Palestine[/I]. Jones’s output was so idiosyncratic and prolific that he would remix anything he was given to suit his purposes and recorded an album almost every week. Jones could have been a potentially controversial figure if his releases were available in anything except extremely limited editions—usually less than one thousand copies of each title. Despite their lack of prominence, Jones’s blend of found-sound Middle Eastern and South Asian atmospheres with heavily phased drones and colliding rhythm programs were among the most startling and unique in the noise and electronica underground. The Muslimgauze project ended tragically in 1999 when Jones died suddenly of a rare blood disease. A number of posthumous releases including [i][r=107104][/I] (partially a collaboration with the dub collective Systemwide) and the 9-disc [i][r=206529][/I] soon followed.\"  -John Bush for allmusic.com His discography (96 titles at the time of his death) has nearly doubled since 1999, although this counts reissued titles as well as brand-new titles.",

Around that same time, Darin teamed up with B.L.I.M. to start Archetype Studios where the two beat-lovers banged out the seminal Funky As... single for Marine Parade under their High Prime guise. Darin has always been an seen as an originator in breakbeat. His sound can be dark and ominous, drifting and playful, steeping and funky...just about anything. Listening to his full length album Freaks, Geeks & Mutilations , one can hear the mass of hiphop and ragga influences pouring through the album. In the past couple years, Darin continues to dominate the breaksworld by expanding his affiliations to include Smart Systems label (Electric Kingdom compilation) as well as the mighty Skint Records. His Skint releases include \"That's My Style\" / \"Goose\" and \"Amped\" / \"Transforma\". These two releases show Darin's more swinging, steppy style, which gained them much acclaim from the DJs worldwide.",

Since his first CD was released in 1993, he has consistently produced works that give an opportunity for the listeners to challenge and examine themselves-exploring ideas of place on \"Stomach of the Sky\", qualities of weather on \"Coyot\", and perceptions of microscopic worlds on \"From Within the Solar Cave\". Similar such ideas have formed the basis of his installations such as \"Entering Molecular Streams' (Observatori festival, Valencia, Spain 2000) and \"Circulating Phases\" (Klangturm, St. Pölten, Austria 2001).",

Our use of the name reflects our fascination with the exploration of inner space, but also the nature of our society, in which we are surrounded by layers of makyo, artificial realities, mediated realities, which seem much more real than they are. Our music is about cutting through this illusion in a search for something pure. Makyo formed in 1993 with the desire to incorporate Eastern philosophies of sound and spirituality into the whole spectrum of 90s electronica. The result: zen dub, an organic electro-acoustic sound of tablas, ethereal Indian/Arab vocals, and bass. The band's brief is to ignore the barriers that exist between \"live\" and \"electronic\", \"experimental\" and \"pop\", \"east\" and \"west\", \"traditional\" and \"modern\". Gio, who writes all the music, and plays most of it, went through a long musical evolution before arriving in Makyo. The early 80s were spent in Kyoto, studying zen by day and playing in hardcore punk bands by night. The late 80s were spent in Taipei and Boston, playing in psychedelic Branca-influenced guitar ensembles, releasing through the mail-art/cassette underground, and DJ-ing a free-style radio show on WZBC.",

Their investigations have taken them into fictional cultures where nothing is easily located and reality often slips into the hypnagogic. Having secluded themselves in Newcastle, England since their inception in 1980, Zoviet France have developed a radical relationship with the cheap technologies of old-fashioned tape recorders, homemade acoustic instruments, primitive looping and sampling devices, and basic dub trickery. From these machines, the collective has crafted a distinctly unique vocabulary of postindustrial sonic hypnosis. Just as Zoviet France's sound was alchemic reconfigurations of inexpensive technologies, their vinyl packaging literally covered their sounds with aluminum, roofing shingles and porcelain.

With a DJ career spanning three decades, it would be difficult to find a more fascinating DJ than Cheb i Sabbah. Born in Algeria, a great source of his inspiration were his two uncles who were masters of the Malouf style, also known as Andalusian music. Cheb I described himself as a 'hajji', a musical pilgrim of the spirit. His name is another reference to his pilgrimage: Cheb is a nickname used by Algerian rai singers; Sabbah means 'morning', but the link is actually to Hassan i Sabbah, the Persian mystic whose legendary library is rumoured to be the largest in the world. Cheb i Sabbah passed away on November 6, 2013 in his home in San Francisco due to a stomach cancer.",

Over the last 6 years Oojami has produced 3 albums (internationally released on Miles Copland's label), played hundreds of gigs in over 15 countries, including a tour of the US/Canada, and featured on more than 30 compilations around the world. Recently he's begun writing soundtracks for major Hollywood movies, and his music has been licensed to EMI Arabia. Oojami's music is groove orientated, and band is described as 'global band with Turkish influences'.",

  "realname": "Brian Peter George St John le Baptiste de la Salle Eno",
  "profile": "Brian Eno is an electronic musician and producer. Also known for his multifaceted interests outside of music, especially technological. He was born 15 May 1948 in Woodbridge, Suffolk, UK. He attended Ipswich and Winchester Arts Schools where he studied with [a=Tom Phillips (3)], Roy Ascott, [a=Christian Wolff], Anthony Benjamin, [a=Noel Forster] and [a=George Brecht]. Starting his musical career early, first thing of note being with the band [a=Roxy Music], Eno has gone on to produce a number of highly eclectic and increasingly ambient electronic and acoustic albums, and also works frequently as producer for many popular artists. He is widely cited as coining the term \"ambient music\", with his series of albums using the term recorded between 1978 and 1982. He collaborated with [a=David Byrne], formerly of [a=Talking Heads], on \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Brian-Eno-David-Byrne-My-Life-In-The-Bush-Of-Ghosts/master/6392]My Life In The Bush Of Ghosts[/url]\" (1981) which was one of the first albums not in the rap or hip-hop genres to extensively feature sampling. Eno collaborated with [a=David Bowie] as a writer and musician on Bowie's influential \"Berlin Trilogy\" of albums, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Low/master/22382]Low[/url]\" (1977), \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Heroes/master/22294]Heroes[/url]\" (1977), and \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Lodger/master/22318]Lodger[/url]\" (1979), on Bowie's later album, \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-1-Outside-The-Nathan-Adler-Diaries-A-Hyper-Cycle/master/22350]1. Outside - The Nathan Adler Diaries: A Hyper Cycle[/url]\" (1995), and on the track \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/David-Bowie-Im-Afraid-Of-Americans/master/53966]I'm Afraid Of Americans[/url]\" (1997). He  has also collaborated with [a=Robert Fripp] of [a=King Crimson], [a=Robert Wyatt] on his \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Robert-Wyatt-Shleep/master/23627]Shleep[/url]\" (1997) album, with [a=Jon Hassell] and with the German duo [a=Cluster]. Eno is also well known for acting as a producer for a number of bands, these include [a=U2], [a=James], [a=Coldplay], et al. He won the Best Producer award at the 1994 and 1996 BRIT awards. He is an innovator across many fields of music and collaborated on the development of the Koan algorithmic music generator. He has also been involved in the field of visual arts. In 1996 Brian Eno, and others, started the Long Now Foundation to educate the public into thinking about the very long term future of society. Brian Eno is also a columnist for the British newspaper, The Observer.",

The techno uprising was underway. The music sounded other-worldly: sub-aquatic basslines raced with hi-hats constructed from welding sparks. It was like listening to the liquid electricity of one man’s soul. A part of the original Detroit “Holy Trinity” with [a=Juan Atkins] and [a=Kevin Saunderson], Derrick took the Euro-electropop crystals of Kraftwerk, Depeche Mode and New Order beyond its own horizon, infusing it with house, experimental synthesizer work and just plain soul. Songs and albums like \"Nude Photo\", \"Strings Of Life\", \"It Is What It Is\", \"Beginning\", \"Relics\" and “Icon” run deeper than genre molds can grasp. Referred to as the \"Miles Davis of Techno\", Mr. May has worked with some of the most experimental and creative musical artists in the world, such as [a=ABC], [a=Depeche Mode], [a=Fine Young Cannibals] and [a=System 7].",

The backbone of The Rurals, Andy Compton began his musical career back in 89 playing guitar in a funk rock band (based in Nottingham). He left to pursue dance music following the now infamous Castle Morton gig, where he stumbled across the DIY tent and fell in love with deep house. After parting with his band he went back to his roots in the South West, this is when the Rural vibe all started to happen! After organising and playing some crazy all night parties in rural locations, booking quality DJs from all over the UK, Andy decided to join a local DJ agency.  At the same time he also teamed up with  Pete Morris, a top keyboard player who had just moved back from Leicester, between them they hired a local studio and started buying equipment.  Soon they had enough material for their first release \"Space Funk E.P\" Playing out at gigs in the Warehouse Plymouth they met resident DJs Matt C and Dean Westcott, who were soon interested in the Rural vibe and joined them in the studio recording under the name Rainbow Garden. The results of this were sent on tape to numerous people, DIY were first to reply securing \"The Groove Orchard E.P\". Following this release The Rurals wanted to record under their own label so they hooked up with the guys at Ideal and formed The Rurals / Idea label. A few sweaty years, 11 x 12\" E.Ps and 1 L.P later they finally formed their own record label Peng. And with the help of new in house vocalist  Marie, who added her sweet soul vocals to the Rural sound to give it a unique quality.",

The story of Hardcore Blasters label is deeply attached to Dj D's, since the label was born after he gave (1999) a tape demo to Simone (chairman!) and he like it. Of course the first demo was not released on vinyl (however insert on Jump vol.1 compilation), but with this one , DJ D career could have to start! During 2000 Dj D try to improve the sound quality of his products, so in November 2000 , with his friend Luca Morlini (Dj Lux) performed his first record DJ D vs DJ LUX \"Inside myself E.P.\" and Hardcore Blasters label started to moved! Through the years he improved his sound quality level, performing some remixes for some djs! Hits like \"Original Style\" DJ D remix was been included into several hardcore compilations and played by some famous Djs like Promo,Endymion,Nosferatu. During the 2002, he started to develop his own unique style of production which resulted in his first 10\" record called \"X-ploration\" which was released in June 2002. \"Mankind warning\" was the hit-track played by several djs like Endymion & Nosferatu in some parties! It was included in several important hardcore compilation like MOH, Always Hardcore,Hardcore Ressuretion and many other... So after this project, Dj D performed a remix of \"Getting High\" for Ferox released on Bionic records, for The Blaster, B 747 & Angels of Darkness. Together with Valentino Oliviero (The Blaster), he became PSYCHORUDES and he is 50% of Angels of Darkness & Noize Creator too! Later he created two albums; DB Area and The Melody Man. His greatest hits came in 2007 and 2008 with \"Gloria\" and \"Imagine (When I Found You)\". Several other hits followed, as well as collaborations with new producers of Hardcore Blasters like Nitrogenetics and Rayden. In 2013 Diego Buffoni announced his retirement from the hardcore scene and from Hardcore Blasters. He stated that he no longer has the time to keep quality of his production high. At that time he had a 16 months old daughter, choosing family above music.",

  "profile": "Growing up in the 1970s, Miller soaked up the musical environment surrounding him in the Motor City, taking a particular interest in the sounds of Motown, Philadelphia, Parliament-Funkadelic, and Santana. It was during the early '80s once the \"dance music crazed\" Alton became friends with a young [a=Derrick May] that he decided to start spinning records, citing Chicago DJs such as [a=Ron Hardy] and [a=Frankie Knuckles] as prime influences. By the latter part of the same decade, Miller joined forces with George Baker and [a=Chez Damier] to start the Music Institute, a short-lived but legendary Detroit club that has since become near-mythical, thanks to the pioneering techno efforts of figures such as May. Following the demise of The Music Institute, Miller took an interest in Conga drumming in addition to DJing, which led to a period between 1989 and 1991 where he toured the world with his music. He then joined forces once again with May, first as an employee of the artist's [l=Transmat] Records label (he also played bongos at [a=Silent Phase]'s early shows), then as Aphrodisiac, the title under which he would begin releasing his music. Besides his EP on Transmat's sublabel [l=Fragile], he also released his music on Kevin Saunderson's [l=KMS] and a series of EPs on [l=Serious Grooves]. By the mid to late '90s, he had increased his presence in the Detroit area through a number of DJ performances and a stream of stunning twelves. His debut album for Distance has been highly acclaimed as all things house. His current [l=Peacefrog] album 'Stories Of Bohemia' is a powerful, moving collection of mature jazz tinged, soulful house grooves with flavors of African and roots music. Alton Miller is picking up from where he left off in 2015 and rolling in 2016 on mission to make this year one of his most prolific ever. 2015 saw him re-introduce his label InnerMuse Recordings with his own signature sound on Whereabouts Known. During Movement 2016 in Detroit, Alton Miller played with Chez Damier for the first time since the Music Institute closed in 1989, during a party organized by fellow DJ [a=Kai Alce]. Alton Miller also inaugurated the new Adeen Record label with a first EP, called “More Positive Things”. He released another EP “The Vault” on Italian DJ Volcov’ record label, [l=Neroli] early October 2016.",

  "realname": "Joaquin Claussell",
  "profile": "American DJ, remixer, musician, and label owner of both labels [l=Spiritual Life Music] and [l=Sacred Rhythm Music]. Born: 1971 in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, USA. Joaquin \"Joe\" Claussell was born in Brooklyn to a large and diverse Puerto Rican family with deep musical roots. His first exposure to entertaining audiences was in his own neighborhood at block association events, musically led by one of his elder brothers Larry Claussell. Not long after he hit the club scene, beginning collecting vinyl at the age of 15 and his diverse taste for music and dance led him from a club called \"The Inferno\" to punk music’s sanctuary \"[l=CBGB]\", the alternative driven \"[url=https://www.discogs.com/label/422320-Mudd-Club-New-York]Mudd Club[/url]\", the more mainstream \"Underground\", and the legendary \"[l=Paradise Garage]\". While living in New York City's East Village in the early 1990s, he found and fell in love with a record store called Dance Tracks, forming a friendship with the owner, Claussell became the store’s DJ and had weekly parties that drew a diverse and increasingly devoted crowd of music lovers. Following an invitation from  and good friend and owner, Stan Hatzakis, he began producing, completing his first remix “Over” and his produced first track \"Awade”. Over time he learned the music business and eventually took over Dance Tracks alongside [a=Stefan Prescott]. In 1996 Claussell launched his independent eclectic world house label [l=Spiritual Life Music] from the back of Dance Tracks, and around the same time over saw the birth of [l=Ibadan Records] with friend and executive producer [a=Jerome Sydenham]. He later expanded into label [l=Sacred Rhythm Music] in the 2000s. The labels’ productions featured organic African, Brazilian, Latin, and Middle Eastern rhythms, crossing over into Disco, Jazz, House, and other electronic music, with him being intricately involved in every aspect of the production process: music, writing, selection/creation of the visual art, and graphic design. These labels have nourished many fledgling artists, with first release \"Nothing's Changed\" by [a=Ten City], followed by works from [a=Jephté Guillaume], [a=Mateo& Matos], [a=Slam Mode], and [a=3 Generations Walking] among others, along with his own first full-length album \"[m=88340]\" (1999). Popular and underground artists and labels have sought him out for collaboration and remixes, including those of [a=Femi Kuti], [a=Herbie Hancock], [a=Beth Orton], [a=Stuart Matthewman] (of [a=Sade]), [a=Cassandra Wilson], [a=Diana Ross], and [a=Manuel Göttsching], to name a few. His remixes have revived classics such as [a=Hector Lavoe]‘s classic “Alejate;” [a=Cesaria Evora]’s “Sangue De Beirona”, and [a=Nina Simone]'s “Feeling Good” – the latter featuring on prominent TV show “Sex And The City”. Joe’s \"Feeling Good\" remix sung by the late Nina Simone was solely responsible for the reemergence of the song, which spawned countless remakes. Since 1996, Claussell joined [a=Francois K] and [a=Danny Krivit] to play for the legendary “Body& Soul” Sunday afternoon dance party, and for 6 years music and dance lovers from NYC and around the world came every week to experience the totally unique musical journey of classic, world, soul, disco, funk, and house. Claussell's demand as a producer and remixer keeps him working and continues his worldwide DJ-ing schedule. His artistic talents are also sought after in the visual art world, where he toured with a project titled “Trembling Sensing Space”, produced by Dutch theater director Lidy Six. As a musician, Claussell has toured with the likes of the world-renowned percussionist [a=Mino Cinelu], and he has also played alongside pianist/keyboard extraordinaire [a=Bugge Wesseltoft] in a band that includes [a=Erik Truffaz], [a=Ilhan Ersahin], [a=Erik Holm], and [a=Torun Eriksen]. While in New York, he also began the \"Sacred Rhythm Party\", designed to bring house music and live musicians together in an intimate environment, and his first Internet radio show titled “an invitation to openness”, gives him the freedom playing whatever speaks to him at that moment, as opposed to being at the mercy of the listening audience. He is the brother of percussionist [a=José \"Cochise\" Claussell].",

  "profile": "Born a child of Hip Hop, Hollis P. Monroe explored every facet of the then developing culture. Starting out as a casual observer, he quickly became a contributor through break-dancing, djing, rhyming and tagging. Always searching for other artistic outlets, he found what would eventually lead to his true and final calling: beat making. During his high school years, Hollis was formally introduced to [a=Prince] via a friend's copy of \"Sign O' The Times\" and it changed his musical perspective forever. He became inspired to play his own self-taught chords and melodies along with the samples he used in his Hip Hop productions. From that point on, Hollis consumed a strict diet of Hip Hop and [a=Prince] and expelled a weird hybrid music which became the foundation for everything he does musically today. In college, Hollis was reintroduced to electronic music (which he vaguely remembered from his break-dancing days) and began experimenting with a formula to combine the mechanics of electronica with the organics of his style. Aided by his friend, musical counterpart, and business partner Kyle Odum, they started a demo production company called [l=Renaissance Infinity Recordings] which eventually evolved into a small record label. On this label, they would release their own tracks to gain exposure and make an attempt at music as a career. Renaissance Infinity's release of \"The Stupid Def EP\" marked a turning point where lifelong dreams of success seemed to be within reach. Recorded under his early turntablist pseudonym, [a=DJ Decent], it was Hollis's tribute to his B-boy beginnings. This very diverse collection of breakbeat-laced tracks received very favorable reviews from magazines such as XLR8R, Urb, and DJ. It also received high acclaim from individuals including [a=Keoki] and [a=Alex Gifford] (from the [a=Propellerheads]) who listed \"Reflex Speed\" in his top nine all-time favorite records on the internet magazine Ultra. This particular track from the EP, is frequently noted as a standout on DJ Icey's mix CD \"The Funky Breaks\" to which it was licensed. Avoiding the typical pigeon hole effect, \"R.I.\" followed \"Stupid Def\" with a deep house-influenced track called \"I'm Lonely\". Completed in approximately three hours, this was the unexpected result of Hollis's mood during a solo recording session at home. Only available as a promo with no credit given or taken, it was destined to become an underground classic. Judged only on the merits of Hollis's chords, melody, bassline and use of a vocal sample by [a=Terence Trent D'arby], it was quickly added to the charts and playlists of many notables such as [a=DJ Sneak], [a=Kenny Dixon Jr.], and [a=Manny Ward] to name a few. Eventually, it's underproduced yet mysteriously complete sound reached the ears of [l=Stickman Records], who licensed it and immediately used their resources to take things to the next level.... The end result: licensing to an unheard of 7 labels around the world, 11 remixes, over 60 appearances on CD compilations, a video, and recognition as an instant classic.",

All songs by Morgan, who at that time went under the moniker: Cylus, were made entirely with a low budget program called \"Impulse Tracker\", which allowed musicians to arrange and compose songs entirely on a computer, without an external sampler. A year later, Morgan mailed a demo tape to 99.9 FM \"The Buzz\" to production manager and DJ Jason Steeves (formely of WFNX), who hosted an electronic specialty music show on an otherwise commercial station. The tape received weekly airplay. Morgan continued to move forward, buying records, reading the industry publications, and absorbing as many influences he could while working to improve his music. Eventually, Morgan landed his own weekly radio show on WRUV at the University of Vermont- very rare for a high school student. Originally the show was a spot he was filling for a DJ on the popular Saturday night time slot. This inspiring experience eventually got Morgan into DJing and introduced him to the plethora of domestic and international underground electronic independent record labels which came by the box-load every week. In the early stage of the show, Morgan was mainly playing trance music, but this phase soon died as the radio station starting receiving a few now famous deep and hard house albums: Barada - Strategies For A Deeper Design, Terry Lee Brown Jr. - Chocolate Chords, and Swayzak - Snowboarding in Argentina. These albums entirely changed the way Morgan looked at music, and thus became pivotal points in the music that influenced his creations. After interning for Plastic City in New York, house music become more and more a labor of love. This prompted Morgan to finally lay down the cash and buy some real music equipment. Always revising and improving his personal music style, Morgan is attending Emerson College and currently making deep house in Boston.",

  "name": "Wyndell Long",
  "profile": "A devoted music fiend since the age of 7, Wyndell grew up on black radio during the P/Funk era in Chicago. A move to the Suburbs changed his listening perspective to a much wider spectrum of music. Prince, Streisand, Rolling Stones, any body who made a song he liked was purchased no matter what genre it was. He was also lucky enough to be right in the middle of the Chicago / Detroit house-techno movement. DJing was a hobby until he quit college in pursuit of a career in music produc-tions. He had primarily Hip Hop and alternative music in mind because at the time the House scene was dead in the States (due to bad business practices). A DJ friend of his who had been recording for DJAX brought some records he was spinning over to his place and let him listen to them for a couple days. That's when he channeled his energies in the pursuit of House and Techno. The music he thought was dead was alive and well. His first endeavors into the dance scene started with co - production and remix work as well as monthly mix tape produc-tions. Without any contacts or help he pursued a EP deal of his own and hooked up with Peacefrog (UK) in 96 and have been busy and consistent ever since. Isophlux is happy to bring you Wyndell Long's debut release for Isophlux. A great collection of deep&amp; dark techno tracks that hit all sides just like we like it.",

  "profile": "This critically acclaimed house Dj, production team, comprising Paul Davis and Matt Jackson, met in a record shop in 1996. They attracted the attention of high - profile DJs (such as Mr C, John Digweed and Tyrant) and critics with a string of 20 melodic and well-produced singles between 1998 and 2000, all enigmatically named after colours. Their debut, the aptly named, Colours received wide praise from all corners of the music press. The Face magazine made it Album Of The Month and commented: \"Circulation’s pure house is built for the heart as well as the feet\". Their DJing engagements at clubs such as Bed, Fabric and Renaissance drew similar comment. Unusually, their performances feature a mixture of the duo playing technology ‘\"Live\" and DJing. The sound of their productions appeals to fans of house, trance and techno as it draws influences from all three genres. [i] Circulation's Debut Weaves Sweet Technicolor Dreams. Undulating colors: For the past two years, London - based production outfit \"Circulation\" has been releasing one color - coded single after another. Uptempo titles \"Green\", \"Blue\", \"Orange\", \"Grey\" have been wholly embraced by club-land's house contingent, which now encompasses tech-house, deep trance, deep house, filtered disco, nu-disco, classic house, and all points in between. Circulation - Paul Davis and Matt Jackson - recently delivered its debut album, the Mr. Fingers - splashed \"Colours Of Circulation\" via its own label (Circulation Records UK). And quite frankly, if Circulation hasn't yet crossed your radar screen, weel, it's time to wake up. In addition to highlighting 11 classic tracks, the two disc set (on the duo's own Circulation Records UK) also presens nine exclusive new tracks. Primed primarily for post-club, \"Back to Mine\" play, disc one soothes with the lush beats of \"Cerise\", \"Burgundy\", \"Cyan\" and \"Mauve\". Conversely, disc two shines the light on clubbier, more urgent fare like \"Crimson\", \"Amber\", \"Lemon\" and an alternate version of \"Scarlet\". Between the two discs, listeners are taken on one wicked musical journey, complete with peaks and valleys. Now, seriously, when was the last time that happened? This is the stuff technicolor dreams are made of. These days, and after recently completing a DJ tour of the Far East and Australia, the incredibly photogenic Davis and Jackson are in the studio working on their second album, which should street next year. Now, if only a US label would open its ears to the sounds of Circulation. Billboard, August 26, 2000.[/i]",

From the early '80s his musical influences were leaning towards all things electronic and slightly more eclectic than your average ten-year-old Scandinavian kid growing up in the middle of the Cold War. In the late '80s Jori's musical passion started displaying itself when he discovered the slightly more abstract form of electronic music, namely Detroit techno, and house music. While earlier influences included slightly more traditional pop music from Depeche Mode to Pet Shop Boys and from John Foxx to The Smiths, the new wave of American electronic club music pushed Jori towards experimenting with structures and textures that were far removed from those roots. Still, a lot of those early influences pushed through in his productions.",

  "profile": "Lenny Dee started his career in DJing in the 80s at a local roller disco in Brooklyn NYC at the age of 17, which become his first residency. Lenny Dee is recognized as one of New York’s earliest Techno pioneers. His earlier music consisted of Disco, Electro-Body, High Energy and early House. Lenny crossed paths with NY legend/ Radio DJ and Producer - Tommy Musto. Tommy and Lenny went on to make over 20 records together on Tommy’s label Fourth Floor that became underground hits in the U.K. Lenny furthered his career by collaborating with Techno legend Frankie Bones and the DJ / Producer team of Frankie Bones and Lenny Dee was born. Their music catapulted on the British charts, with the XL-Recordings release Looney Tunes in 1989. The two Brooklyn born natives stormed through the UK'S dance scene with a style of breaks and pounding grooves that still influences Techno music today. Lenny Dee took a short break to finish his Recording Engineering degree in New York City’s Institute of Audio Research. This led him to NY’s prestigious [l=Skyline Studios], which at the time was the home of one of Lenny’s idols – legendary producer/singer/songwriter Nile Rodgers who is the producer of Chic, Madonna and David Bowie among others. He left Skyline to work for another musical pioneer [a=Arthur Baker] the owner of [l=Shakedown Sound Studios] and Producer of the [a=Soul Sonic Force].

In 1989, Lenny’s musical exploits brought him to Europe, which changed his direction once again. Lenny Dee’s DJing career propelled him to be one of the most sort after International Techno DJs in the world.

A native of North London, Lexton listened to Public Enemy, Stetsasonic and Mantronix as a child, and began working in the studio with help from his brother Charlie, who co-owns the Filter label and records as Cool Breeze. His studio prowess and wide-eyed youth gained him the name Kid Loops, and he recorded his first single \"Alien Resident\" for Filter in 1995. Lexton again worked with his brother on Kid Loops Vs. Cool Breeze, an LP released as Special Projects in late 1996. Singles followed for All Good Vinyl and Filter once again, before Lexton's proper debut album, Time Quake, was released in mid-1997. - John Bush",

He studied for four years at the University of Adelaide's EMU music technology unit, and has since composed music for theatre, film, television ads, and computer games. A multi instrumentalist, he started his music career playing saxophone and is a dab hand on the drums and bass guitar and has on various occasions provided rhythm back up for Australian band Brunatex. Over the space of five full-length albums, Tim Koch has covered a lot of ground sonically, choosing to experiment with mood and texture, but perhaps never committing wholly to one focused style. Initially coming to the attention of the electronic scene under the moniker Thug, utilising detroit styled percussion immersed within a mesh of rich synth pads, he reverted back to his birth name for his subsequent output, toying with more playful sounds, and eventually settling into more contemplative and considered sounds with the Islandtones release on Belgium's U-Cover imprint. His latest album \"Faena\" distils and refines the elements that have featured in all of his previous releases, drawing on a broader range of sounds including acoustic guitars, female vocal elements, and raw found-sounds. The bulk of the album was written whilst on tour in Europe, with a cramped Antwerp loft acting as a makeshift studio.",

Machines and hardware have always fascinated Chris, his influences are wide ranging:  Kraftwerk, Jean-Michel Jarre, new wave groups such as Depeche Mode, New Order along with some disco touches.  Pioneering techno radio stations like FG and Maxximum allow him to discover techno, it’s on FG that he gains his first experience as a DJ, under the name of The Exorcist in late 1992. He hosts a radio show on this Parisian station every Friday night for a year and a half.  During the same period he decides to consecrate himself completely to music and works at Laurent Garnier’s Parisian record shop USA Import. He starts mixing more and more across France and Europe, starts tinkering with machines and gets into production.  After a couple of tracks which make it into compilations, and three singles on Step 2 House, in 1995 he signs to F Communications, the label run by Eric Morand and Laurent Garnier.  He changes his pseudonym – Chaotik Ramses is born. Wishing to further the French electronic music scene, in parallel he gets involved in organising parties with the ‘Mentasm’ collective from 1995 to 1996.  He is also co-founder of the D-Mention parties (1997 and 1998), which brought together 6.000 ravers. He becomes the resident DJ at the mythic Rex club, first of all with D-Club where he invites the cream of US DJs, notably from Detroit, this sound is his strongest musical influence. Next follow the Automatik parties every Friday, which are today the reference in techno parties in Paris and in France. Today Chris multiplies the collaborations with different artists, as well as releasing singles and remixes on labels such as Wall Keys, A-Traction and Kobayashi, always looking to advance his music.  Stay tuned to this frequency…",

  "name": "Lil' Louis",
  "realname": "Marvin Louis Burns",
  "profile": "American DJ and producer, based in Chicago, Illinois, USA. Born: 13 May 1962 in Chicago, Illinois, USA. One of the most popular Chicago house producers during the late 1980s thanks to his massive club hit \"French Kiss\", Lil' Louis was also the only Chicago producer to successfully deal with the major labels; he released two albums for Epic, and only left the label at his own instigation. Born in Chicago, Louis was the son of guitarist Bobby Sims, who recorded for Chess and appeared with the psychedelic-soul unit [a=Rotary Connection]. He grew up with nine siblings and played both drums and bass as a child, then began DJing in the mid-1970s (he earned his nickname after appearances at the club River's Edge while still in middle school). By the end of the decade he had his own club, the Future, where he began working on his editing techniques, thanks to a cassette deck and later a reel-to-reel recorder. By the 1980s, Lil' Louis was hosting the biggest house parties in Chicago, and he began recording his productions around that time as well. His first single \"How I Feel\" appeared on his own label, and he began collaborating with [a=Marshall Jefferson] on several tracks, including \"Seven Ways To Jack\" by [a=Hercules], [a=Byron Stingily]'s \"I Can't Stay Away\". In 1987, his new single \"French Kiss\" became a local hit, then a platinum-selling international classic after being licensed to [l=CBS] and [l=FFRR]. The success triggered a major label contract through [l=Epic], and the release of his debut album \"From The Mind Of Lil' Louis\" (1989). Charting a course across jazz-fusion and R&B as well as house, the album was one of the best produced by any of the Chicago figures, and included session contributions from [a=Larry Heard], [a=Die Warzau], and his own father on drums. From the album, the moody single \"I Called U\" became another club hit. His follow-up album, the more stylistically unified \"Journey With The Lonely\", didn't fare as well and Lil' Louis retired from recording for over four years, preferring instead to set up his own studio in New York and work on production with [a=Babyface] and [a=Me'Shell Ndegeocello]. He returned by collaborating with \"Little\" [a=Louie Vega] of [a=Masters at Work] and also worked on production for [a=Black Magic].",

Thus, ManMachineMan was born and their desingated outlet for production has become the Mole label. \"You can't listen to technoid beats all the time.\" says Jost. \"When driving home from the clubs, you need music to relax and come down!\" Levent explains:\"This is another league, another level of making music. This doesn't have to be something for your feet only, than even more for your peace of mind.\" With ManMachineMan, the two have created a platform from which they can impart a different style and feel even more free to stimulate the listener's creativity.",

His first productions followed soon after with \"The Big Deal\" breaking Terry into the world of production back in 1993. Immediately Terry's talent was recognized, and he began contributing more tracks to the global underground. Succesful records like \"Tales of Mystery\" produced together with Tom Wax of AWeX began making waves in the scene. After his civil service he decided to dedicate his life to music and build up a studio of his own. According to Terry, \"Music was always one of the most important things in my life so I took the chance to realize this dream.\" In 1995 he met Alex Plastic who had just founded the Plastic City label for which he first did a remix of Soundcraft's house- classic \"The Movement, the Message\". In autumn he presented his first release as Terry Lee Brown Junior, the Tribal Nova EP, a multi-faceted, but resolved three track EP. \"Tribal Nova\" was the percussive trippy house track, \"Brother For Real\" was a more type of a cool summer-evening track with a touch of jazz, and the third track \"Bad House Music\" became a pumpin' clubhit. Terry's goal was to never produce one kind of music. He strived to incorporate all of his favorite elements into one cohesive piece of music that was new and innovative. By fusing elements of house, techno, jazz, downtempo, and even drum and bass, Terry began to develop his own distinctive style.When asked about his sound, Terry will say \"I am a many sided guy and I am just doing the music how I feel when I am in my studio.\"",

  "profile": "Laidback Luke was born in Manila, the Philippines on 22 October 1976. The first time Luke was confronted with making electronic music was at a friend's who owned an Amiga computer. He showed Luke that he could make songs with bits and pieces of other songs. It was then that Luke realised he wanted to make his own music. Equipped with only one of the first soundcards in his PC he made his beginner tracks. One day Dobre (Good Men, Trancesetters& Basco) had to dj at Luke's school. Luke went up to Dobre and asked him if he could send him a demo-tape. After sending the tape and getting some feedback from Dobre, Luke bought himself a synthesiser. Dobre and Luke kept in contact and planned midnight sessions at Dobre's studio, listening records. Dobre pointed Luke in the right directions and at the early age of eighteen Luke got his first record deal. Going out to parties inspired Laidback Luke. It was here that he got to know about \"dance floor energy\". Being a house music freak, Luke got influenced by MK, Todd Terry, DJ Pierre and Carl Craig. The urge to search for harder stuff came when he got confronted with Relief Records. He became a real fan of that funky hard Chicago sound. Luke grew quite an image for his hard techno sound, his new work is miles away from the abstract, minimal techno. Luke found this part of the dance-scene being too limiting, and eventually not very inspiring anymore: 'That's the reason', he says now, 'That I didn't produce that much in the last two years. I needed to find a new sound. Something that would inspire me again.' All this resulted in the release of his first artist album \"Electonic Satisfaction\"(Virgin/Labels) in 2002. This album includes great tracks like \"Popmusic\" and \"Rocking with the best\".",

It was elected Record of the Year in England and was also nominated for the Dance Music Awards in London. His involvement in music happened almost by chance. Early on, our bedroom composer dreamed of a career in sport. As an adolescent, his passionate interest in sailing, windsurfing, skiing and the like was cut short by an accident. He put out a number of EPs under a variety of pseudonyms. He soon dropped a straight techno style in favor of a more sensuous, melancholy musical approach. From this time on, a new cardinal point was added to the New York/Chicago/Detroit axis: Paris.",

  "profile": "A crucial figure on the outskirts of Detroit techno since the mid '80s, James Pennington's recordings as the Suburban Knight pioneered the moodier side of the Motor City with classics like \"The Art of Stalking\" and \"The Groove.\" And though he collaborated on the biggest hit to come out of Detroit, the techno-pop monster \"Big Fun\" by Inner City, he later recorded with subterranean mainstays [a=Underground Resistance]. It was through his connection with another Detroit mainstay, [a=Derrick May], that Pennington began recording. May had set up his own [l=Transmat] label in 1986, and Suburban Knight debuted the following year with the third release for the label, \"The Groove.\" He had also been working with [a=Kevin Saunderson] (who was also his room-mate for 3 years), and co-wrote \"Big Fun\" with Saunderson and [a=Arthur Forest]. After vocals were added by [a=Paris Grey] and the record was released, it became a worldwide hit and virtually defined early Detroit techno for many foreigners. Though Pennington only released one more single for Transmat, it was the dark classic \"The Art of Stalking.\"  After the commercial success of 'Big Fun', he signed a deal with [l=Paragon] but released very little as they wanted a more commercial sound. This deal prevented him from released anything for around 3 years. With the rise of Detroit's second wave in the early '90s, Pennington became a mentor for Mike Banks and the Underground Resistance crew. With UR, he released the singles \"Nocturbulous Behavior\" and \"Dark Energy.\" He also featured on the [l=Submerge (3)] label compilation Depth Charge, Vol. 3, and produced tracks for Underground Resistance's 1998 full-length Interstellar Fugitive. James' Debut album 'My Sol Dark Direction' was released to critical acclaim including both classics and new, unreleased productions.",

  "profile": "Dutch underground acid/house/techno outfit Random XS released it’s first 12” vinyl in 1992 on the famous Djax-Up-Beats label, not long after their first live gig. It kick-started an international career, lasting for almost 25 years now. Random XS members DJ Zero One and Frank de Groodt are clearly influenced by the early Chicago acid house and Detroit techno pioneers. But they developed their own unique style: dark and deep, yet intense and in-your-face. The vintage Roland x0x drum machines and analogue synthesizers play a key role in their live sets, but these are spiced up with mind-bending effects & sounds. Unlike many so-called ‘live' dance acts (who use more or less pre-recorded elements), Random XS always performs 100% live. Rhythms are programmed on the fly, ingredients are replaced all the time. So, no two gigs are alike. The live atmosphere adds a new and unpredictable dimension: a random excess! History Random XS was founded in 1991, when Sander Friedeman (aka DJ Zero One) joined forces with school-mate Arno Peeters (aka Sp@sms / TapeTV) to perform live on a small underground party in their hometown Utrecht. A tape with tracks from that gig was send to the then upcoming Djax-Up-Beats label. Their first 12\" 'Give Your Body', with the 12 minutes long title track, was released. It quickly gained worldwide support from many famous DJs. This marked the start of a long international career. The ultra-dark 'Fading Away' from their second 12\" was picked up by the legendary Sven Väth, who invited the band to perform at his infamous Omen club in Frankfurt. In 1994, Arno Peeters left Random XS to be replaced by Frank de Groodt. More 12\" releases followed, and in 1997 the full length album/CD 'Braincloud' was released, also on Djax-Up-Beats. Live Random XS performed in cities like Paris, Cologne, Basel, Glasgow, Brussels, Munich, Vienna& Chicago. They featured on big raves and festivals like the Berlin Love Parade, Mayday, Nature One and Mystery Land. However, they always tried to remain 'underground' and didn't sell out. Despite their commercial success, they kept playing on underground parties and squatter raves, too. In the late nineties, Zero One decided to focus more on his DJ career. He keeps performing live with Random XS only occasionally, and no new music is released. Until 2015, when the first new Random XS 12” since 1997(!) was released on the Dutch Shipwrec Records. Appropriately called ‘The Return’, it marks the comeback of the Random XS project. The new sound is more mature, deeper than ever, but still focused on the dance floors around the world. Live, Zero One still performs together with Frank de Groodt, who is an established producer himself nowadays.",

  "profile": "Born: 22 May 1969 in Detroit, USA. Carl Craig was a key player in Detroit techno's second wave, following the futuristic lead of originators [a=Derrick May], [a=Kevin Saunderson], and [a=Juan Atkins], and eventually collaborating with May. He began recording at the turn of the 1990's, using a number of aliases to release innovative ambient, techno, breakbeat and future jazz sounds. One such alias, [a=Innerzone Orchestra], issued \"[r=37872]\" in 1992, the track largely responsible for moving drum 'n' bass away from the sounds of hardcore and ragga. He later reconvened Innerzone Orchestra as a jazz/techno combo, recruiting jazz composer/keyboardist [a=Craig Taborn], former [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Sun+Ra]Sun Ra Arkestra[/url] member [a=Francisco Mora Catlett], and [a=Matthew Chicoine] to help him record 1999's album \"[r=43817]\". Matt Chicoine, under alias [a=Recloose], later signed for Craig's own label [url=http://www.discogs.com/label/Planet+E]Planet E Communications[/url], a peerless dance label employing the same eclectic and futuristic ethos that informs his own music. With releases under many aliases, including [a=BFC], [a=Psyche], [a=Paperclip People], [a=69], [a=Designer Music] and [a=Innerzone Orchestra]; Carl Craig has more musical personalities than the average electronic artist. As much as his different guises can confuse though, his music is always easily recognized because whatever he does, it retains that certain Craig-ness of sound. A deep commitment to soul mixed with jazz, often including but not exclusively so, a detroit techno sound, has always been the watermark of his music. Even when Craig is destroying dance floors with such songs as the classic track \"[r=161616]\" (or one of the very many versions of it!) there is always a subtleness and attention to detail that separates his music from that of the typical dance music producer.",

  "profile": "[a=Ron Maney] also known as DJ Skull lived in the Southside of Chicago (IL, USA). His musical career started during the summer of 1986, while recovering from a broken bone. During the following years he homed his craft, DJing first at basement parties, building his reputation to go on to larger events such as, loft and hotel parties, and eventually the infamous Music Box and Power Plant clubs. At the age of fifteen Ron shopped his first demo at [l=Trax Records]. There he first met Chicago's legendary DJ [a=Ron Hardy], working as A&R for Trax Records. Two years, and a new alias later (DJ Skull) later while at the Power Plant, Chicago's own [a=Steve Poindexter] heard a DJ playing one of Rons tracks, and met Ron. Steve was now A&R at [l=Saber Records] and invited Ron to release some tracks. So in October of 1991 DJ Skull's first record \"N.R.G. Music\" was released. In 1993, he released the EP \"The Stomping Grounds\" on [l=Djax-Up-Beats], which was more noted than the first one. Over the years that followed DJ Skull released lots of EP's on several labels. He has become well-respected producer and DJ in the Techno industry. He was playing at famous events in the USA and Europe such as: Planet Djax 1 (Chicago, IL), Mayday 8 (Germany) and The Lollipop (Sweden) just to name a few.",

  "profile": "Akilah Bryant also know as Black Widow has been on the Chicago Party Scene since the late 80’s. Hailing from the Northside of Chicago, Akilah started her journey at Medusa’s, where Alternative music was the popular genre. Soon after hearing DJ Skull spin at an underground party, she attended all of the legendary clubs, such as the Power Plant, the Musik Box, and numerous hotel parties. In 1991, she met DJ Skull, where they became a powerhouse team, with Skull producing, and Akilah singing. After spending countless hours in the studio, Akilah decided it was time for her to come out with her own style of tracks, something that would encompass femininity, techno, and the soulful disco that was played at all of the Chicago clubs. With this in mind her first E.P. Urban Electronics on DJAX, hit the ground running. After this release Akilah started performing live P.A.’s, with the first being at Planet DJAX, the DJAX tour. From there she released another classic E.P. titled Black Widow, which contained the Acid anthem “Eye Trip”. Also released by Akilah, and co-produced by Skull was Arachnophobia on the Swedish label Hybrid. Black Widow went on to perform all over the country, and abroad, unique tracks that embody her style. Back to the drawing board Akilah decided to go more into computers, and has designed the website for their new record label Hypnotic Tones. With Skull on the tracks and Black Widow on the web, this is sure to be one of the hottest Chicago Techno labels around. Also, they will debut Akilah’s label Urban Electronix, which will allow female artists that have a love for Chicago Techno to showcase their talent. Stay tuned for all that Black Widow and DJ Skull has to offer.",

He made the switch to house music in 1985 when the first wave of Chicago house hit NYC that same year. In 1989 he started releasing some of his early productions on several small New York record labels whilst he was working as a courier. A year later he caught the eye of [l=R& S Records] in Belgium and by mid 1990 released his first major record with that company titled \"Energy Flash\". Beltram soon followed with some equally impressive releases. All through the 90's he has created some of the most timeless music on some of the most cutting edge labels of the decade. In 1999 he formed [l=STX Records], which he currently records for under both JB³ and Joey Beltram.",

The group formed out of a series of fruitful remix collaborations done before the name \"Sabres Of Paradise\" was used — including \"Papua New Guinea\" by [a=The Future Sound Of London], [a=Flowered Up]'s epic baggy journey \"Weekender\" (renamed \"Weatherall's Weekender\" over two drastically reworked and extended balearic house/dub remixes), and [a=The Moody Boys]' \"Centre Of The World\". The group released its own material starting in 1993 but was known more for a series of adventurous remixes of other artists under the Sabres name. When the trio disbanded in 1995, Weatherall went on to form [a=Two Lone Swordsmen] with producer/engineer [a=Keith Tenniswood], while Kooner and Burns joined [a=The Aloof].",

Within a year, they had released two more EPs on Duophonic, collected on Work & Non Work, released on Warp, in 1997. It would take nearly three years for Echo’s Answer, their next EP, to be released, shortly followed by the band’s first album, The Noise Made By People, and three more EPs. This profusion of EPs has shown that, far from being a simple tool to promote their albums, they are actually a platform for the band to explore and take their sound to uneasy territories. Broadcast’s intimate experimental pop is fuelled with references to the work of the seminal [a=BBC Radiophonic Workshop], [a=Ennio Morricone] or [a=John Barry]. Often associated with [a=Stereolab] in the early days, the sound of the band has developed considerably since. Lead singer Trish Keenan died of pneumonia on 14 January 2011 at the age of 42.",

In September 1997 they released the single \"Press A Key\" after being approached by [a4698176] of Wurlitzer Jukebox. Snapped up by Warp on the strength of this single they introduced themselves with \"Plaything\" on the \"WAP 100: We Are Reasonable People\" compilation and played live at John Peel's Meltdown festival. In September 1998 \"Plock\", their first single release for Warp, brought about much critical acclaim.  Such reviews resulted in Plone being tipped for 1999 in publications as diverse as Muzik, Music Week, Dazed and Confused as well as being listed as one of the singles of 1998 by the NME and single of the year by the Melody Maker. They began to build collections of old drum machines, analogue synthesisers and effects. Their musical influence came from music that has shown an imaginative and loose sense of technological experimentation whilst retaining a pop sensibility. Influences like Kraftwerk, John Barry, The Upsetters, The Beach Boys, Flying Lizzards, Suicide, Sun Ra, Joe Meek and 80's electro pop.",

When he began listening to music, however, it was the sound of early-'80s synth heroes like Devo, Severed Heads and New Order alongside early hip-hop, jazz and 60s Hindi film soundtracks. Geist released his first 12\" (via Dan Curtin's innovative Metamorphic label) while studying at Oberlin College in 1994. He formed Environ soon after, releasing powerful statements of purpose which showed his affinity for the more emotive strains of disco, techno, soul and all flavors in between. His debut album was released in 1997 and licensed to EastWest/Warner. Geist continues to run Environ today. A highly-regarded remixer and producer both solo and as half of Metro Area, Geist has lent his touch to a wide range of artists including Hugh Masekela, Telex, Erlend Øye and The Rapture.",

  "profile": "Named for a character on the '60s TV show Flipper, Porter Ricks specialize in subaquatic dub techno, providing the closest touchstone to the static hum and fuzzy beatwork of their quasi labelmates Basic Channel. A collaboration between ambient maestro Thomas Köner and beatmeister Andy Mellwig, the duo debuted with three 12\" releases on the Basic Channel sublabel Chain Reaction during 1995-1996. Filtering out any of the harder effects from Detroit techno and Plastikman material with what sounded like an affinity for undersea sonar frequencies and wind-tunnel ambience, the singles became quite popular with the growing experimental techno scene of the mid-'90s (and even influenced Plastikman in return). By the time of the 1996 CD collection BioKinetics on Chain Reaction, Porter Ricks had moved on to Force Inc. with the double-pack Redundance EP, plus the singles \"Spoil\" and \"Exposed.\" The duo also recorded a single for Barooni before collecting their Force Inc. material onto a self-titled 1997 CD. Two years later, the Techno Animal collaboration Symbiotics appeared. Following the album's release, Mellwig released a full-length as Continuous Mode, and Köner continued releasing innovative ambient recordings on labels like Mille Plateaux, Touch, and Die Stadt. In 2016, Porter Ricks reunited for a performance at the Berlin Atonal festival. This was followed by the release of the Shadow Boat EP (on Tresor), the duo's first material in 17 years. The full-length Anguilla Electrica arrived in 2017.",

His first single for Aphex Twin's Rephlex label, \"Scharlach Eingang\" (1994), published by Warner / Chappell Music, was sufficiently accomplished that the British music magazine NME ran an article claiming that Bochum Welt was another of Aphex Twin's alter egos. Di Costanzo's first album on Sony Music Japan, \"Module 2 / Desktop Robotics\" collecting his first recordings, was followed by a double CD Rephlex release Robotic Operating Buddy. \"GOOD PROGRAMS (to be coloured in yellow)” his more recent album (2014) was released by BMG / Rephlex records. In addition to releasing his own music, Di Costanzo has worked with Thomas Dolby's Headspace and Beatnik Inc., the Hollywood companies that completed multimedia productions for S.

Keir Fraserello and Giacomo Braddellini have been making music for many years in different guises before combining forces in Rome in the early nineties. They have been working with some of Italy's finest musicians on their latest album, \"Sweet Jones\", recorded in the Umbrian Hills near Orvietto. Gianluca Petrella plays trombone, Mishael Levron guitar; Manu Bandettini plays flute with Adriano Tirelli on bassoon. The combined force brings you one of the freshest records to come out of Italy for some time.",

Dave Clarke began his music career as a Hip-Hop DJ in the mid 80's, shifting to Acid House and later to Rave near the end of the decade. He began recording for [l=Stress Records] (as [a=Pig City]) in the early 90's and also appeared on [l=R& S Records], [l=XL Recordings] and his own [l=Magnetic North]. By the mid 90's he had gradually shifted away from Rave to a brand of straightahead Techno with the ferocity of Hardcore yet the sublime feelings of classic Detroit Techno. A series of three 12's named Red 1/2/3 gained fame during 1993-96 (the last entering the Top 40 in the U.K.), as did his ferocious DJ sets. He's also known as a radio presenter, at the end of the year 2000 he hosted his own radio show Technology on Studio Brussels in Belgium where he promoted new Techno and Electro artists (for example [a=Terence Fixmer]). But due to recording and touring commitments the show was canceled. In September 2006 he launched a new radio show White Noise, originally broadcast on 3FM in the Netherlands, his show gained success and is now played in the Netherlands (3FM), Belgium (Studio Brussels), Ireland (2FM) and Turkey (FG Istanbul). Also thanks to the success of White Noise he launched a new label [l=White Noise (4)] too, where he releases music that he played on his radio show that has not been released on other labels, mostly by lesser known producers.",

His second record release was a collaboration with another producer, [a195631], \"Die Herdplatte\", which was a bigger success than his first. Gary D also gained Maas a residency at Hamburg's famous club, The Tunnel, between 1994 and 1996, playing also at the historic Bristol club Lakota. Maas also began to release records through record labels such as [l1359], both under his own name and the alias, [a1013].

  "profile": "Plastikman is Richie Hawtin's main recording identity. Since his debut as States of Mind and FUSE in 1990 to the launch of Plastikman in 1993, his sound has developed through early connotations of acidic techno and extreme levels of energy ('Spastik', 1993) to sonic experiments in futuristic-rhythms and off-world ambience ('Consumed' LP, 1998). More minimal approaches were evident through his year long 12-record project 'Concept 1' from 1996. His recording attention is matched head-on by his groundbreaking DJ performances, which incorporate turntables, effects processors and additional instruments (Roland's TR-909 drum machine and SH-101 synthesizer). His world-renown enhanced DJ set-up of the DE9 series has kept pushing the boundaries of what a DJ can do by increasing the potential of creativity through once again, technology. At timewarp on March 27th, 2010 Hawtin launched the first in a series of hand-picked dates that form the first ever Plastikman Live world tour. His live electronic performance incorporates his state of the art visual architecture and interactive technology. The new show evolved from the previous Plastikman live performance at Canada’s Mutek festival in 2004, by continuing to explore the connection between visual, audio and interactivity, and once again partnering visual architects Derivative alongside visual designer Ali Demirel.",

  "realname": "Richard Melville Hall",
  "profile": "Born: September 11, 1965, Harlem, New York, NY, United States. One of electronic music's most visible and talked-about figures, Moby's career comprises many years of work and many musical twists and turns. His career stretches all the way back to early rave and acid-house releases in the late 80s and early 90s as U.H.F. and Voodoo Child, through to his much loved/hated R&B/blues/pop/techno sample cut-ups of today. His most notable tracks from his early days include \"Next Is The E\", \"Everytime You Touch Me\" and \"Into The Blue\", and the classic \"Go\", as well as his early albums \"Ambient\" and \"Early Underground\". He was manged by Marci Webber. A brief outing into more rock-oriented territory came with 1996's \"Animal Rights\", followed by \"I Like To Score\" in 1997, highlighting his past movie score contributions (most notably a remix of the \"James Bond Theme\"). In 1999 and 2000, Moby found unprecedented pop success with the album \"Play\" and the slew of singles and radio tracks that came from it (\"Honey\", \"Run On\", \"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?\", \"Natural Blues\", \"Porcelain\", \"Southside\", and more). Among other things, his appearance as a DJ in the foyer of the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards (wearing a gold suit and playing two golden copies of \"Play\") led many people to decry him as a sellout. Nonetheless, his follow-up album \"18\" tinkered very little with the \"Play\" sound and still received a mostly positive reception in 2002. Besides the many faces of his music, Moby also gathers controversy for his outspoken religious, dietary and animal rights views, as well as persistent rumors that his live shows are mostly pre-recorded. Every Moby release from the mid-90s onward has borne the text \"Animals are not ours to eat, wear or experiment on. Thanks to Christ.\"",

  "profile": "If David Chong has become a producer of international reach on planet House, it has nothing to do with fashion vagaries. Sound is a precious material and it has to be thoroughly studied before one can shape it to perfection. David grows up with his eyes and ears widely open to the world. His father is a biochemist and the family travels to many places: Guyana, Ivory Coast, Madagascar... They end up in France in 1988. Time for graduation and above all, time for David's first nights out around Paris and its suburbs and for his first mixes in rave parties. In 1990, David studies economy and gets his diploma, he's on the right track. Thanks to his brother RLP (Hip Hop DJ and artistic director in a record company) David moves away from his economy diploma and starts a trainee in the Guillaume Tell recording studio, at that time the best in town. That's where he's going to understand the importance of studio work. \"Everybody can learn how to mix records with two turntables in three weeks. A sound engineer does real work\". Six months later, David is fired for not showing up at a session. His trump card: he meets a publicist who lends him his professional home studio. That's where he will make his first three 12\" inches that will come out on a small label in 93. From then on, David makes records the wild way and goes around most of the independant parisian labels (Pschent, Basenautic...) 1997: reunion with Bruce Skin, head sound engineer at Guillaume Tell's. He has his own studio, Avec Brio. Both found of Funk, Bruce and David create the Sunshine Funk collection and pull out four 12\" inches. At the same time, David goes on the air with Sunshine mix on Radio Nova. That's where he meets Dee Nasty, the Hip Hop chemist. Together they bring forth the anthem of the 1999 Techno Parade \"Music makes me dance\". After twenty 12\" inches/remixes and two compilations, David Chong comes out in the States on Trax and Guidance and puts his sharp yet sensitive sound engineer's ear at work on Dee Nasty's fifth album. At the moment, after joining Le Maquis, David Chong prepares his first album, somewhere in Amsterdam. Complete quietude. Complete modesty. \"It takes many nights, many years to understand the subtley of a machine\". (by Philippe Pierre-Adoplhe&amp; José-Louis Bocquet)",

  "profile": "French DJ, producer, remixer, and recording artist. Born: 1 October 1963 in Istanbul, Turkey. Compared to his cohorts in the new wave of French dance music, Dimitri From Paris looks much farther afield for his influences. While both [a=AIR] and [a=Daft Punk] make much of their affection for the music of the 1970s (prog and disco, respectively), Monsieur Dimitri's inspiration comes from the Continental jet-setting faux-jazz of the 1950s and early 1960s (exemplified by [a=Dick Hyman], [a=John Barry] and [a=Martin Denny]), though the whole is updated by his long years of experience as a house DJ. Based in France, though he was born in Turkey, Dimitri entered the dance music community during the mid 1980s by DJing at the French Radio 7. By 1990 his reputation had allowed him to record soundtracks for fashion barons like Chanel, Lagerfeld, and Gaultier. He released two solo EPs during 1993–1994, plus the mini-LP \"[r=206161]\" (1995), and contributed to the [l=Yellow Productions] compilation \"[m=179292]\" (1995). He also remixed hundreds of artists, including [a=Björk], [a=Brand New Heavies], [a=New Order], [a=James Brown], and [a=Etienne Daho]. His debut album, \"[m=95619]\" (1996), appeared in at the end of the year, also on [l=Yellow Productions]. Named 'Album of the Year' by [l=MixMag], it sold several hundred thousand copies around the world and finally received an US release in early 1998. A mix album \"[m=35943]\" (1997), however, showed the Frenchman coming back to his house roots. In lieu of a second production album, he mixed several more sets before working on a new album. These included \"[m=95624]\" (2000), the [l=BBE] box set \"[m=182723]\" (2000), \"[m=95629]\" (2002), amongst others. Second studio album \"[m=95633]\" (2003), meant to be the sequel of \"Sacrebleu\" (1996), but without any use of samples. [a=Pink Martini], [a=Omar], and [a=Daniel Wang] were among the collaborators. Since then, he has continued to release many DJ mixes, and continues to remix and DJ extensively.",

  "profile": "Vicki Bennett, under the name People Like Us, has been smash-and-grabbing from the shallows of cultural waters for eleven years. Over the course of more than ten solo albums, as well as dozens of contributions to compilations and collaborations with like-minded artists, dadaist samplings and reshuffling of cultural oddities have been recurrent themes. Likewise, the use of \"found\" and recontextualised recordings into entirely new soundscapes has played a major role, exposing simultaneously the ridiculous and the sinister. People Like Us expose a surreal world of bad connections and faulty communications, where presenters, interviewees, lost stars and found sounds become trapped in a misfiring loop of reference and repetition. Bellowing a gagged love song in a stifled spew, this mean mash of psychobabble is a window into a world of monotony induced trance. Using modern tools as afforded by the advent of desktop video/audio manipulation and editing, People Like Us create new landscapes where once were merely soundscapes; the two disciplines are seamlessly melded together. There is no limit to the possibilities for new emerging narratives in the visual and aural world of People Like Us, narratives spoken in a voice unique in the world of mixed-media appropriated art. At present is working on a commission (\"in.site\") for The Lux in London, for an online a piece about the benefits of keeping archives not just in the past, but available to the present. In September 2003, Vicki performed a concert at the Pompidou Centre in Paris, and also took part in the symposium, Sample Culture at the Tate Modern. Vicki also has a weekly radio show, \"DO or DIY\" on Wednesday evenings on WFMU in New York.",

  "profile": "Demon, a French producer, has already left behind him an unusual and promising trail. Though he was influenced by artists from a wide range of disciplines (Kitano, Bukowski), Hip-hop was his first musical love ([a=Mobb Deep]). Correspondingly, in the early '90s, while Rap is exploding in France to full effect, he produces an aggressively underground album (\"Symbiose\"), already beyond classic conventions and inspirations. For Demon, it's the creation of a label, [l=20000st], that in turn allows him to widen his musical horizons. From November 1997, he produces \"A-Typique\", his first 5-track EP, ahead of its time, claiming the combined influences of Hip-hop and Funk. This EP experienced an incontestable commercial and media success, the programming of \"Lil'Fuck\", highlight of this EP, was equally explosive on Radio as on the House scene. April 1998 was marked by the release of Demon's second EP, \"Electronic Boogie\", as precursory as ever, with its electro edge foreshadowing the present trends. [l=Solid], the famous Parisian label, then chose to bestow on him responsibility of creating Poumtchak #6, following in the footsteps of [a=Dimitri From Paris], [a=Alex Gopher] or indeed [a=La Funk Mob]. Given rave reviews in numerous magazines (NME, I.D., Magic, Groove Germany) this record achieved as equal a success in France as on the other side of the Channel. After having created remixes for [a=Alex Gopher], [a=Jean-Louis Murat], [a=Mr. Oizo], [a=Etienne De Crécy] and a good many others, Demon launched his first LP \"Midnight Funk\" on february 2000. This LP confirmed the hopes made about the young phenomenon, who is already considered as one of the best artist of the \"french touch\" movement. Filled with melodic, groundbreaking house sounds, this opus is an end-of-century musical synthesis. \"Midnight Funk\" blends various styles (Hip-hop, funk, electro) on a trip to an imaginary world where a city resounds with music that is both melancholic and celebratory. The extraordinary world success of [a=Demon] vs. [a=Heartbreaker] hit \"You Are My High\" and its sulphurous video, left us eager to discover Demon's future relases. This totally innovative video, nominated at the \"Victoire de la Musique\", is the essence of the single and has greatly contributed to give the single a large publicity in the media. In 2002 Demon is nominated at the MTV Music Europe Awards for the \"Best French Act\", next to artists such as [a=Manu Chao] and [a=Daft Punk]. The same year, Demon worked on a new original music project, \"Branding\", a new album with famous and exclusive remixes, skilfully combining a variety of surprising rhythms. \"Branding\" is the result of Demon numerous works for various artists who asked him to mix some of their singles, such as [a=Etienne Daho], [a=Bran Van 3000], [a=Benjamin Diamond], [a=Roy Davis Jr.], etc... In 2002, after the release of [a=WUZ], a project he has been working on with [a=Alex Gopher], Demon released his second album \"Music That You Wanna Hear\".",

Inspired from an early age by his musician father, he pursued his own interest in music and became well known and respected within the community. It was later when he heard Jeff Mills in 1985 as \"The Wizard\" that he discovered the innovative sounds of Techno. Through a mutual friend he was introduced to Mike Banks and joined Underground Resistance in 1994. In 1999 'Knights of The Jaguar' although not Rolando's first release on UR turned perceptions of Techno on their head, breaking into other genres of dance music and becoming a classic in the boxes of DJs such as Tenaglia, Morillo, Oakenfold, and Gilles Peterson. The track has a long legacy of reworking and lives on fifteen years later inspiring audiences from all genres. As of November 2004, Rolando left both Underground Resistance and his Los Hermanos project behind. 2014 Rolando has launched his own label R3 ( Roland Rocha Records) and will exclusively release his own music on his label. Rolando now a Dj for almost thirty years continues to work internationally as a Dj and continues to hold a residency at the notorious and enigmatic Berlin club Berghain.",

  "profile": "Born: December 9, 1962. A major electronic music pioneer from Detroit, Juan appeared behind aliases such as [a=Cybotron], [a=Model 500], and [a=Infiniti] releasing many classics of Detroit techno. The 1982 electro track \"[url=http://www.discogs.com/Cybotron-Clear/master/130]Clear[/url]\", recorded by Atkins and [url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Richard+Davis+%283%29]Rick Davis[/url] as [a=Cybotron], is often considered the first proto-techno track. Continuing to experiment by fusing the extra-terrestrial funk of [a=Parliament] [a=Funkadelic] with the futuristic rhythms and hard math of [a=Kraftwerk] and the progressive dance theorems proposed by [a=Giorgio Moroder], the Model 500 12\"s on his own label [l=Metroplex] laid the blueprint for Detroit techno. Along with the tracks made by two schoolmates from the grade below, [a=Derrick May] and [a=Kevin Saunderson], Detroit techno quickly made its way across the atlantic and immediately sparked the emerging rave culture and soon after the entire global dance community. Moving through the later 1980's as [a=Model 500], Atkins continued as one of the most prolific and sought after producers of electronic music throughout the 1990's, culminating in the use of an Atkins' original as the musical bed for the 2000 launch of the Ford Focus 'Detroit Techno' automobile. Packing clubs nationally from Detroit to NYC, internationally from London to Venezuela, Juan has mastered the art of soaking up new rhythmic elements from contemporary dance music while keeping his unerring, instantly recognizable sense of melody intact. Much discussed and anthologized not only for his 20 years of production credit but also for his ability to rock a dance floor, Juan Atkins' music and DJ-ing is deified in Europe and embraced all over the world. Juan has also been prolifically releasing albums, remixes and collaborations on Belgium's [l=R& S Records], Germany's [l=Tresor], and others.",

  "realname": "Alan Oldham",
  "profile": "One of Detroit's most talented and venerated techno mixers, DJ T-1000 has been instrumental in the Motor City scene as a label-head and producer as well as DJ. Born Alan Oldham, he spent time as a graphic-design specialist and comics illustrator while studying media at Detroit's Wayne State University. Hired by [a=Derrick May] to illustrate the sleeves on a few [l=Transmat] releases, Oldham became interested in Detroit's electronic scene, and gradually transformed his Fast Forward radio program on WDET from industrial and fusion into techno. During the show's run, from 1987 to 1992, Oldham introduced thousands of area listeners to Detroit techno via productions from May, Kevin Saunderson, Juan Atkins, Underground Resistance, and Carl Craig — as well as other techno figures like Joey Beltram, Moby, 808 State, and LFO. The show ended in 1992 when an offer to tour with [a=Underground Resistance] as the replacement DJ for [a=Jeff Mills] proved too difficult to resist. Also in 1992, he formed his own Generator label, the origin of seminal releases by Oldham projects like [a=X-313] (\"Interferon\", \"World Sonik Domination\") and [a=TXC] as well as tracks by [a=Dave Clarke] and [a=Woody McBride]. In 1996, Oldham closed Generator and opened a new label, [l=Pure Sonik Records]. He also began DJing around the world, gaining a reputation as one of the best Detroit DJs among considerable competition. The DJ T-1000 mix albums Supercollider (a Generator label retrospective) and Live Sabotage: Live in Belgium displayed his mixing genius, while his debut production full-length, Progress, appeared on Tresor in 1999. Oldham also began recording another album, for Astralwerks. In addition, he has recorded for [l=Djax-Up-Beats] (also did label artwork), Matrix, and [l=Communique Records], and has done remix work for Terry Lee Brown, Jr. and the Punisher.",

  "realname": "Leo Järveläinen",
  "profile": "Techno/Hardtechno producer, live act and DJ Leo Laker (Järveläinen in finnish) was born 1980 in Espoo, Finland. He grew up listening to all kinds of different music, from heavy metal to electronic music and jazz. He started making he's own music at the age on 13 with Amiga's ProTracker software, composing first game and demo music. About two years later, after getting more into listening to techno and house, he bought he's first decks and started learning to DJ. At first he played mostly in discos and parties organized with he's friends, trying different styles like goa-trance and house. ​ After hearing Jeff Mills' legendary set from Liquid Room Tokyo and the early stuff from Swedish producers like Adam Beyer and Cari Lekebusch, he got more into buying techno records and shortly after started producing he's own tracks. In 1996 he sent a c-cassette with couple of tracks to Berlin based Tresor records. They liked what he had sent and asked for some more, first planning to release few tracks on a compilation, but then decided for a solo EP. Leo's debut \"6am.\" was released in 1998, receiving very positive reviews and launching he's recording career. In 2001 after constantly searching for harder sounds, he created a second alias, Switchblade and released \"Switched To Blades EP\" on 4X4 records which is considered being one of the first records that shaped the new hardtechno/schranz sound and Switchblade as one of the pioneers of the style. To date, Leo has released more than 30 EP's, plus numerous tracks and remixes for other artists. As a DJ and live act, he's played all around the world and worked with many of the biggest artists in the hardtechno scene, most notably he's productions and live performance act with the Polish artist Tomash Gee. ​ Leo has he's own hardtechno/techno label LKRMusic, and is actively searching and releasing works from both known and upcoming artists.",
